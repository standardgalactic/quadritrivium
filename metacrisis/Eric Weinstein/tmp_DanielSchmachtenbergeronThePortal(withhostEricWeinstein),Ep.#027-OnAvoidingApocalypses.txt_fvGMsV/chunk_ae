it hasn't been shut down at the moment the best thing that the gated institutional conversation
has going for it is that all of these interesting people are simply humans and you can destroy
any human reputation and so the cheapest thing to do is not to kill anybody right but just as
somebody starts to accumulate mindshare the gated institutional narrative goes into into hyperdrive
and it just starts pumping out um fear uncertainty and doubt which is the you know fud is the major
tool for destroying an individual's ability to communicate reality yeah something I think about
is the people who went through what happened in Syria recently or say collapse in Libya or
wherever where you had an actual pretty developed nation that didn't also expect that it was going
to go through war and collapse and then it did I bet that if we talked to those people they would
have a very different intuition for the state of the fragility here because they actually have
first person experience it's something that seemed really stable and like it wasn't going to collapse
actually did and most of us haven't actually been through anything like a collapse in our life and
we don't have a good intuition for things that are only in history books and so this is a place
where our intuition by itself like our intuition is informed by our experience but our experience is
very short right and if we study past civilizations one of the things we know and you know we can read
tainter and the collapse of complex societies or you know other kind of good insights on how
civilizational collapse works but none of the previous civilizations are still here like that's
that's one of the important things to get is that they go through a lifecycle and that they mostly
collapse for self-induced reasons and that even if someone else overtook them oftentimes the group
that overtook them was smaller than rivals that they had fended off previously because they had
already started going through institutional collapse or civilizational collapse and if we look
across all of them there are some things we can generalize about what leads to civilizational
collapse but I think the difference now versus any of those other times is that due to globalization
yeah in some ways the US and China are different civilizations but both of them would fail without
each other currently and like we don't make our own computational substrate we don't make our own
lots of things right like they don't do their own fundamental well but this is part of the hope
but the architects of many of these systems believed that a kind of economic
mutually assured destruction yeah was the best way of producing I think that's been true
well so I was going to bring up the case of Europe so one of the arguments for the European
experiment is that you Europe is actually arguably the world's most dangerous region
um people are very competent and they're long-standing rivalries and hatreds
and you had some desire to create something that seems impossible which is a United States of Europe
and nobody was going to sign up for that so how do you do that well you back you back them into
a financial union without political union you give them their ability the ability to issue their own
debt but not an ability to print their currencies and then you wait for the collapse to come
and then you hope in this storyline anyway you create a federation which becomes a political
federation the United States of Europe is created because of a sovereign debt crisis and we sort of
went through that which I believe was a was sort of a sought after outcome which is maybe hopefully
people will print their own their own debt and they'll issue debt and they won't be able to print
their own currencies in order to inflate their way out of it ergo something positive will have to
happen that seems to me to be also a recipe for disaster and that the architects of these plans
seemingly died and everybody's on autopilot not understanding you know I've seen this in the in
in terms of certain us policies where people create a policy for reasons that nobody's really
understanding and a short time later nobody even knows why the policy was created the real reason
and to begin with do you see that this kind of a world I think that's actually one of the
meaningful dynamics in institutional decay and in civilizational decay is that a new civilization
is formed coming out coming out of a war or after a migration or through a famine or after
like some really difficult thing yeah and to really be able to build something new took real
capacities what you would call the contact of the unforgiving right like real empirical capacities
and so studied my lingo sir a bit yeah and I think that's really good lingo because
like the I can't I can't lie to physics and have it reward me for it right like
either I can grow corn or I can't grow corn either I can win at a war or I can't but
there's a real situation and so oftentimes when we go from non wartime where the generals are
politicians to wartime where the politician generals who maybe suck at war start losing
battles and we cycle through looking for ones who are good at it then we get some who are actually
good at war those difficult situations select for real empirical capacity but when you don't have
those difficult situations then you're actually selecting for who can do politics best which
means convince everyone of something whether it's true or not well this is what I call sharp
minds versus sharp elbows yeah and so you have the people who are at the beginning of figuring
out how to do some new civilization and those people had some capacity to be in direct contact
with reality and figure stuff out and then oftentimes what they pass on is the stuff they
figured out but not the psychology in them and the capacities to figure stuff out to the generator
function of the civilization models lost and so now we start getting copying errors and people
are hopefully trying to at least copy it earnestly so now we've got a constitution or a set of law or
a set of market practices or whatever it is but we don't really understand how we generated that
effective thing and so that also means that as the environment changes we won't be able to adapt
it adequately and that also means that we're not going to know how to deal with failures of it so
then some people recognizing that start realizing that they can do better by defecting on the system
and kind of preying on it then by participating with the system and so and this is what we think
of as corruption right where they can start maximizing their own bonus structure or do a
backend deal or whatever and so long as it's adequately hidden they can get away with it and
now that collapses the civilization even further so it goes from loss of generator function to
copying errors to incentive for internal defection and disinformation and you know like I think that
every civilization has faced this a loss of intergenerational knowledge transfer because
it's not just the knowledge it's the generator function of how well but it's also the case that
real knowledge I think has become too dangerous to transmit and real knowledge
doesn't know what the social norms are and you know certainly the biological world
is so disturbing I mean there's no corner of the biological world that you can look at
and not come away thinking wow that's incredibly disturbing and what we're seeing right now a
situation in which we can't cope with any discussion of biology every single attempt to have a real
biological discussion given all of the social issues that it would bring up immediately ends
in madness I've just seen no ability to talk real biology in public and so this is the earliest
place where I can see here's a subject a science that actually can't be discussed I don't have
anything in particular in mind it's just you know like you know bob trivers work on parent child
conflict if we have a beautiful story about how mothers would do anything for their children
and somebody comes along and says no it's actually a struggle where mothers want to hold on to their
resources because they're going to have many children and the child attempts to gain as much
resource as possible without regard for the mother that's so against the hallmark card version of
motherhood for mother's day that we can't have a discussion about parent child conflict in biology
it's not that one isn't about gender it's not about race it's not about you know power dynamics it's
about it just immediately runs into one of our cherished nonsensical points of view
or that the market is self-correcting the market is always self-correcting and knows best that the
leading thinkers are all sitting in institutional chairs that every previous civilization was
the Hobbesian bias brutish nasty short dreadful lives and that everything is awesome just in the
last little bit because of this system so don't criticize the system too much exactly so this
the weird thing that I'm finding is that you can't start interesting conversations not only
about the pessimism of the impending collapse if we keep this up but about the optimism about well
what might we do differently like we can't get energized to actually use this period of time
to do something novel and interesting and hopeful okay so think about this the you know the definition
of infidel for kind of a jihadist ideology is anybody that's not supporting the jihadist ideology
the definition of which to the crusaders was kind of a similar thing right the I have a friend who
went and looked at a bunch of the intelligence agency documents in Yugoslavia and some of the
Baltic nations that had been declassified after the USSR collapsed specifically regarding how
the intelligence agencies influenced the definition of psychiatry and their equivalent of the DSM
and so there was something like their definition of diagnostic and statistical manual for psychology
which tells you when somebody is meant to be as a personality disorder neuroses you remember the
previous definition of female mania during the Victorian period right which basically translated
to she had a sex drive and so that was like a mental illness and but uh so they their definition
of something that translated to schizophrenia the first symptom was had negative feelings about the
state and the second symptoms might take a while to show up and so what I think happens is that the
dominant system ends up eating psychology and saying that the psychology that supports the
dominant system is healthy psychology and anything that is dissenting to it's not healthy it ends up
eating spirituality and virtue and ethics and academia and whatever to basically say the the
behaviors that support the system are good so the thinking that supports those behaviors is good and
anything that's dissenting is bad and like it's so easy to see it in the crusades or in jihadism
or even in Victorian time period it's just very hard for us to see it about ourselves now but I
think that's actually like one of these fundamental things in terms of you're saying like why don't
we have group sense making is because you have a you have a self-perpetuating system that includes
the self-perpetuation of the memes that support the system I understand well look I also have
I ask it not because I have no ideas why we don't have communal sense making
what I'm confused by is why we are not more successful I mean people in our group and I mean
this in a relatively large and inclusive sense because you and I come from different corners
of this large collection of people I think people are relatively well spoken some of them
have fancy degrees some of them have made money some of them have become relatively well known
for their their thinking and yet that institutional conversation I mean I always liken it a bit to
the difference between wrestling and professional wrestling where in the institutional conversation
you need to know what's going to happen ahead of schedule so that you can know whether you're
going to have that part of the conversation or not or whether it's going to be that the private
conversation that we can't talk about versus the public conversation in this concept that I've
called split-level argument other people have called Mott and Bailey style tactics where you have
some version of the argument that you can make in public and then you have some other argument that
you really have to is governing why you're saying and doing what you're doing all of these things
lead to this very unhealthy situation whereby there is no communal sense making there is a gated
institutional narrative it seems to be decaying progressively year by year nobody's suddenly coming
up to me and saying wow I think CNN and Fox are doing a great job this year where's the hope
where does this get fun and when do we get a chance to to find a portal to a better world
as you see it most likely yeah well I want to start by saying I think this is important
right I think that you doing this it as a portal to a better world where you are supporting
earnest thinking that is outside of institutional context and maybe heterodox but at least earnest
and seeking to be well grounded and the fact that people are interested in it I think is really
important when we come back to the difference between personal incentive and collective incentive
right you say why aren't we more successful obviously it's like okay so what is the incentive
for someone to agree with us that for the most part expressing these things would make them do
less well at politics and their job and maybe even their social club and maybe even be part of the
in group that they're part of whether it's the left or the right or the whatever it is because
then they would be saying things that there's almost no in group that they would be aligned with
or very very small and so you still end up having that there's more selective pressure for the
individuals to continue to be part of institutions even an institutional thought doesn't make sense
here's the part that doesn't make sense to me and very kind of you to say what you just said
but let's imagine that you have a perfect SAT scores you kept your nose clean your whole life
you've gone to Harvard and Yale you've got a position where you're commenting as a professor
with a column in a major publication if that person for example calls me alt right you know
or uh I don't know I mean like I have a Jewish last name I voted for Bernie there's some point
where that person's self-esteem I would imagine they would be so embarrassed to put their
life's accomplishments at risk by just being obviously stupidly wrong
like it just there seems to be no bottom at the moment okay so this is this is important
about obviously stupidly wrong I understand obviously stupidly wrong when your ability
to demonstrate your power is to go out in the public square and say the dumbest most ridiculous
most obviously incorrect thing you can think of and nobody says a word
yeah well one of the things I find interesting is you know if we ask a question like even what's
actually causing coral die off how much of it is temperature versus pH versus nitrogen
messing up the phosphorus cycle versus trophic cascades right how long do we have before the
coral die off what are the consequences of that you know like really important questions right
or what are the actual what really happened in North Korea like why there was such a change
just recently and what are the actual tactical nuclear capabilities that they have or or how
much leakage actually occurred at Fukushima or like any of these things nobody fucking knows
and you'll hear different narratives and you'll hear kind of equally compelling disagreeable
narratives on those yeah and almost no one has the time or the will or the epistemic capacity
to really figure that out so one point is the sense making is actually hard you have a situation in
which a lot of these things are complex enough and there's so much disinformation that when people
try to actually figure it out they just get a they get a information overwhelm and then it's
very hard for them to continue so when you're saying like obviously stupid well there aren't
there's a lot of places where people can hold a train of thought that seems cogent enough
even if it's in direct opposition with another cogent train of thought and like just the plausible
deniability that it might be one of the true ones since nobody can really sense make seems to be
enough and so this is one of the really tricky things is in a world where if I have the incentive
to disinform yeah at various different levels right and then I have exponential information
tech so I can do exponential disinformation now this is when I say that the system's inanimate
any of this example everybody who's seen Tristan Harris's stuff will know this but
if we think about disinformation via the nature Tristan Harris is a mutual colleague
he heads a movement called time well spent and he's trying to show you that your attention
has been effectively weaponized against you where the big tech platforms are figuring out
how to keep your eyeballs on their system right to your detriment right center for
humane technology you can see stuff but like I think I think a lot of people know that news
stations as for-profit companies have to make money right and they make money by monetizing
attention and basically they they sell advertising and the advertisers pay more the more people who
are watching for more total minutes so the incentive of the news station is to make stuff
that is both inflaming and scary and entertaining and whatever will engage people to spend a lot of
time watching it and to not say things it would not be to the advantage of the advertisers that
can afford to pay for them right so they have like they have an incentive to not share really
complex nuance things that will have most people click off but to share things if I see I don't
buy this thing I really don't okay let me give you an argument one of the things that I say that I
think people find interesting is that I believe the National Academy of Sciences and the National
Science Foundation effectively conspired against American scientists and engineers on behalf of
scientific and engineering employers that's a fascinating story I shout it in the public square
now you know I've been asked four times to the National Academy of Sciences to discuss this
so they are certainly taking this quite seriously I've talked to the actual people who are involved
with this it is amazingly interesting you could sell clicks you could you could you could just
get advertisers to buy for the clicks on this story nobody's going to run the story nobody
has run the story and I don't know more than 20 years it's sitting there on servers I don't believe
