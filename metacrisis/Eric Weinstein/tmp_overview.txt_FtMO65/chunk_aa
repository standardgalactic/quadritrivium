Checking Eric Weinstein/Daniel Schmachtenberger on The Portal (with host Eric Weinstein), Ep. #027 - On Avoiding Apocalypses.txt
 In this conversation, Daniel Schmachtenberger and Eric Wyner discuss the potential to change the nature of competition and cooperation in human systems, particularly addressing issues within prisoner's dilemma scenarios. The key point is that if we can change the context and what we consider "winning" to be more aligned with collective well-being rather than individual gain at the expense of others, then the incentive to defect becomes less attractive.

Daniel emphasizes the importance of creating systems where collective intelligence scales with the number of participants, which would make cooperating with the system more beneficial than defecting from it. He also notes that the Dunbar number represents a limit on both value generation and sense-making for informed decision-making.

Eric acknowledges the difficulty in achieving universal adoption of such systems but appreciates Daniel's commitment to engaging with heterodox thinkers in meaningful, critical, and constructive dialogue. Eric expresses gratitude for Daniel's willingness to explore divergent ideas and his approach to conversation that aims to improve understanding.

Checking Eric Weinstein/Eric Lewis on The Portal (with host Eric Weinstein), Ep. #028 - The Singular Genius of Elew.txt
 In this conversation, the speaker reflects on his early career and his journey with music, particularly focusing on his transition from a place of anger and narrow perspective to a more open and explorative phase.
