to come with a Knight's Templar kind of perspective. We've seen that and we've heard that and that
also is not brilliant because the fact of the matter is there are many reasons and many contributing
factors, many dynamics that play into careers, into helium, into buoyancy and the like. And so
over time, I've come to understand a lot more about how energy works and how I've been very good
at transforming the energy in a room and bringing people to these types of ecstasies.
However, there was another aspect that I was less concerned with. Now, I think that because of the
panic attacks and the depression and stuff like that, I was a lot less sensitive to it
because in the anger as well. However, as time has gone by, I've gotten better, I've improved my
technique and I've grown through anger and I've found ways to harness anger and panic attacks
and depression and bring it into the music in a powerful way and in a technical way. It's
caused me to have even more vision and my chest rating has improved. So I'm able to analyze myself
and realize just because I could raise the roof on a place didn't necessarily provide a blank check
for me to get a record deal. They're looking at other aspects and those aspects are important too.
Like, see this is, and this gets again back to the Kenny G. Miles Davis construct the model
because one thing that I didn't understand, if I'm going to work with a record label,
then I'm making an implicit statement there. I'm saying that I want to be a part of their
family. I'm saying that I want to represent them at multiple levels. Now, I was coming from a very
uncompromising place. I was coming from a very narrow, we could say, place. I also was
sub-aware of how I sounded in certain aspects. These days, I've come to understand, as I've
gotten so much better, I've come to understand, wow, there are so many other aspects.
You didn't have the luxury back then. If I can be honest about it, I'm not really ready to be in
front of the world. It's very terrifying having a podcast because I don't have all my stuff sorted
out, but nobody does. Nobody does. One of the things back then is you were a terrifying guy
because you were completely uncompromising. I get in there and I try to have a musical
conversation with you and you're very patient with me, but inevitably it shows the levels that
we're at. I could see how exacting you were. You have been driving yourself. You were in a
competition with you alone, so far as I can tell at the piano, and you've been pushing yourself
farther and farther. I love the fact that you're getting the recognition and that it's giving you
the luxury to look at yourself. As your mental state goes up, the vision expands and your chest
rating improves, but we also have to honor that it may be that it is as a developmental stage,
and just to turn it back to the Kenny G Miles thing, that we want to shed where we were. I
was in a narrow place. I was in an angry place, but sometimes that stuff is like colostrum. It's
needed to get going and you have to go through those periods where you've got that anger and
fear, because that's what causes things to progress. That advanced your story. It's quite the
paradox. I'll have to concede that that's very true. Had I not been so angry, had I not had those
issues, rock would have never appealed to me, because what rock enables one to express, I wouldn't
have had that to express. The lyrics of rock are very different from the lyrics that you'll find
in a Gershwin or a Jazz tune, and it was those lyrics that provided me some escape from some
catharsis. Well, let us give it a say. Screw you to Neil Young and screw you to the Governor of
Alabama in the song. Right. And to your point about swing, the word rock transitioned from
rock and roll where rock is a rocking motion. It's a verb to rock where it's led Zeppelin and
it's just a giant stone edifice and it doesn't move. And the same question comes up with jazz.
But let me ask you, can I lure you to the piano and explore some of these ideas with me at the
keyboard and give my listeners a taste of what we're talking about? Yep. Fantastic.
So
the same thing we'll get from rock sports.
So
Okay, let's start this one.
Okay, let's start this one.
Okay, let's start this one.
Yeah, and I was also able to hear the independence of the lines and I'm assuming that that is a good chunk in pro.
It's all in pro.
