And it is time to hire you as a professor
at a top tier university.
And I'll be happy to talk to you about what happened
when you and Richard Dawkins
had counted each other on stage in Chicago.
Because I think in terms of pure evolutionary theory,
it is time to boost a young Richard Dawkins
who contributed two of the most important ideas
in the form of extended phenotype in the meme,
which largely dislodges the old Richard Dawkins
and his hatred of religion,
which has appeared to take over his thinking
as regards his own contributions to biology.
We got a lot of work to do.
No question.
All right, my friend.
Well, thanks for having me.
Thanks for coming.
