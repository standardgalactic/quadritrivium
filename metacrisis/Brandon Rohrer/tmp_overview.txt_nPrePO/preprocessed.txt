Processing Overview for Brandon Rohrer
============================
Checking Brandon Rohrer/How Bayes Theorem works.txt
1. Bayesian Inference involves updating prior beliefs about a hypothesis with new evidence to obtain a revised belief, or posterior probability.
2. The process begins with a prior distribution that represents our initial beliefs about the unknown quantity (in this case, a person's weight).
3. We then gather data and update our beliefs accordingly, which results in a posterior distribution that is more precise than the prior.
4. In the example given, the prior belief about the person's weight was updated with actual measurements to produce a narrower and more accurate posterior distribution.
5. The peak of the posterior distribution, known as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, represents the most likely value for the unknown quantity based on the updated beliefs.
6. Bayesian Inference is useful because it allows us to incorporate our prior knowledge and update it with new data, resulting in more informed decisions or conclusions.
7. It's important to maintain a level of skepticism and not be too confident in our priors to avoid being misled by our own beliefs.
8. Sherlock Holmes and Lewis Carroll (Alice) both emphasize the importance of considering improbable things when forming beliefs, as it allows for more accurate updates when new evidence is available.
9. The process of Bayesian Inference can be applied to a wide range of problems in data science, statistics, and decision-making where prior knowledge and new data need to be synthesized to form a belief about an unknown quantity.
