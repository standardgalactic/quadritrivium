Checking Brain is (not) a computer/[Seminar] Real-time neuroscience (한글자막유).txt
1. The presentation focuses on tools for real-time statistical inference of neural trajectories and non-linear dynamics, which can enable new experimental paradigms and feedback control systems.

2. One such feedback control system is active exploration of unknown neural states with attractors. This approach allows for better global dynamics inference and can help escape attractor states.

3. The presentation introduces Escape the Maze (ETM), an algorithm designed to explore and learn about new environments efficiently by maximizing intrinsic rewards. The intrinsic reward function combines a count-based reward for revisiting states with a discovery bonus based on distance from previously visited states.

4. Model-free reinforcement learning methods are not suitable for non-Markovian tasks like ETM, where the reward associated with a state decreases once the state is visited. Model-based methods, on the other hand, are more efficient and suitable for such tasks.

5. ETM operates in an uncertain world, updating its internal model with each new observation and using this model to plan control actions that maximize exploration while also learning about the system's dynamics.

6. The proposed algorithm was demonstrated to be effective in exploring complex systems, such as multiple attractor chain link environments, faster than existing state-of-the-art methods like random exploration, random network distillation, and prediction error methods.

7. The research has potential clinical applications, particularly in treating disorders related to consciousness by helping patients escape undesirable neural attractor states.

8. The presenter thanks his lab members, especially PhD student Hosun Al-Sar and former postdoc Iwan Zhou, as well as funding sources and collaborators for their contributions to the research.
