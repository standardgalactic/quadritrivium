sentiment around GameStop was completely incorrect. In fact, it was probably very well deserved.
However, with such an incredibly pessimistic outlook, it may not take a big change to completely shift
that narrative. Not every story turns into a GameStop. Most will go the other way. However,
asymmetry between risk and reward means if you're willing to roll the dice enough times,
eventually the law of averages is going to carry you to the moon. And where might you find that
asymmetry? In places where the masses can't fathom how they'd possibly lose.
So maybe there is hope for us. Probably not. But maybe. Will any of this abstract theory help
to predict anything in real life? I wouldn't count on it. Will I take my own advice to help manage
risk and outsize returns? I wouldn't count on it. Will I not blast lights by Ellie Golding in my
car because that was just theory and not actually anything that happens in real life ever?
