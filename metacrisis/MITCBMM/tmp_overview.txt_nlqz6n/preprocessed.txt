1. A probabilistic finite automaton (PFA) can model sequences where there's a chance to transition between states, unlike a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). In the example given, the PFA could model simple English sentences with loops back to previous words or actions.

2. Sampling from a PFA model involves starting at the initial state and following the transitions probabilistically, which can yield different outputs each time, even with the same starting point.

3. The model's behavior is determined by its internal parameters, which define the probabilities of transitioning between states. These probabilities are influenced by an assembly of neurons designed to make random choices.

4. A PFA can learn to recognize patterns, such as palindromes, by being presented with transitions that represent the rules of a finite state machine (FSM). It can then be asked to generate or verify strings based on these learned patterns.

5. The model was trained using less than 7,000 neurons and demonstrated its ability to simulate an FSM by correctly processing a palindrome sequence (A, B, B, A, B, B, A) and confirming it as a palindrome after a series of steps involving reading, writing, and erasing symbols on a hypothetical tape.

6. All the work presented in this context is available on GitHub for further examination and experimentation.
