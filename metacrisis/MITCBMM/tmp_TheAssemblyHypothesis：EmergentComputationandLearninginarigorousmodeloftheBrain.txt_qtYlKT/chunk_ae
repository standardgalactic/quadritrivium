Okay?
And now, how is this model learning it?
Well, first, the alphabet right now is just A or B.
And we have an end symbol.
That's why it's plus one.
These are the transitions of the finite state machine.
We create symbol assemblies and state assemblies, present the network.
So, this is, again, just by presenting transitions of the finite state machine.
And now, we ask for a string.
For example, A, B, B, A, B, B, A, B, B, A.
Is that a palindrome?
Yes.
Okay?
And now, we run it.
And let's see.
Yeah, it takes a little bit.
Here we go.
So, what's happening here?
This is just what's on the tape, right?
A, B, B, A, B, B, A, B, B, A.
And that's the end symbol.
And in the first step, it is starting here and writing this down.
And then what it does is just checking if the last was the same as the first.
And if so, it erases it.
That's where you get the smaller tape and smaller tape and smaller tape.
I mean, it's just following the finite state machine correctly.
But for a large number of transitions, till you're down to, you know, just B, B, B, B,
and then just B, and it accepts at the end.
Move to the accept state.
Okay?
Anyway, I'll stop here.
All of this is available on GitHub.
And everything was done here with less than 7,000 neurons.
So.
Thank you.
