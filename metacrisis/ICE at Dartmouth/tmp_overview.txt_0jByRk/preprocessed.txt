Checking ICE at Dartmouth/The Nature of Consciousnessï¼š A Neurophenomenological Approach.txt
1. The discussion centered around the concept of lived experience, which is a fundamental idea in phenomenology. Lived experience encompasses the full spectrum of human consciousness, including subjective phenomena like qualia (the phenomenal content of sensory experiences) and intentionality (the directedness of conscious thought toward objects or states of affairs).

2. Phenomenology aims to describe experiences without reducing them to physical processes or psychological constructs, emphasizing the first-person perspective. It seeks to understand how consciousness is structured and how it reveals meaning in the world.

3. The notion of attention was discussed as a key aspect of conscious experience. Increased stability of attention can facilitate access to unconscious aspects of cognition, potentially altering the threshold between conscious and unconscious processes.

4. Embodiment plays a crucial role in consciousness, with most of our cognitive processes operating outside of our explicit awareness or consciousness.

5. The idea of a horizon in phenomenology was explained as a boundary or limit within the field of awareness that defines what is currently accessible to consciousness. This horizon can change as our attention shifts, but it always exists as a structure of the field of awareness.

6. The horizon is not an absolute barrier but rather a dynamic boundary that can be expanded through practices like meditation, which can enhance clarity and stability of mind, thus potentially accessing previously unconscious aspects of cognition.

7. There are limitations to our field of awareness, including physical and emotional constraints, which means there is information beyond our current horizon that we cannot access directly.

8. The session concluded with a reminder that there would be a meditation session the following day at the White Church for those interested, and the group would reconvene at the same location the next morning for further discussions.
