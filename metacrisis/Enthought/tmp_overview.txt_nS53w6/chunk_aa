Checking Enthought/Automatic Code Generation with SymPy ｜ SciPy 2017 Tutorial ｜ Jason, Aaron, Björn & Kenneth.txt
1. **Custom Printer Creation**: We learned how to create a custom printer in AutoWrap to use an external library for mathematical functions (like `fast_math`). This involves subclassing the existing printer and modifying the `pal` function to call the desired external function.

2. **Including External Libraries**: To include external libraries, we need to specify the appropriate preprocessor statements in the code generation process. This allows AutoWrap to recognize and use functions from that library.

3. **Custom Code Generation**: We can wrap generated code into a function and then customize the code generation to suit specific needs by modifying the code printer or code generator objects.

4. **Limited Precision Issues**: When using `fast_math` or any other library with limited precision, we need to be aware of potential numerical instability issues that could cause integration to blow up.

5. **Integration with External Libraries**: By subclassing the printer and passing the custom code generator into AutoWrap's ODE solver (ODEQ), we can integrate external library functions seamlessly.

6. **Final Steps**: Ensure that the path to the external library is correctly specified, and include any necessary preprocessor directives.

7. **Feedback**: If you found this tutorial helpful, consider providing positive feedback. If there were issues or aspects that need improvement, constructive criticism is valuable for future presentations and documentation.

8. **Conclusion**: The session concluded with a demonstration of how to use an external mathematical library within AutoWrap's code generation framework, showcasing the flexibility and extensibility of AutoWrap.

Checking Enthought/Frequentism and Bayesianism： What's the Big Deal？ ｜ SciPy 2014 ｜ Jake VanderPlas.txt
1. The presenter explained the difference between frequentist and Bayesian interpretations of probability, emphasizing that a 95% confidence interval constructed by a frequentist does not mean there's a 95% chance that the true value lies within it. Instead, it means that if you were to repeat the experiment an infinite number of times, 95% of the time the confidence interval you calculate would contain the true value.

2. The presenter used an analogy to illustrate the misunderstanding that can arise from the frequentist interpretation: a conversation between a statistician and a scientist to clarify what the "95% chance" statement actually means in the context of frequentist confidence intervals.

3. The presenter argued that Bayesianism offers a more natural way of handling nuisance parameters and interpreting errors, as it allows scientists to directly state the probability of the true value lying within a given interval.

4. The presenter acknowledged that both frequentist and Bayesian approaches have their place in statistics, depending on the context and the nature of the data or problem being addressed.

5. The presenter pointed out that while frequentist results can be empirically tested by running experiments multiple times, the accuracy of a Bayesian analysis depends crucially on the choice of prior distribution. If the prior is not correctly chosen, it can lead to biased results.

6. The presenter suggested that learning when to use each approach and interpreting statistical results carefully are crucial for scientists, and recommended looking into the proceedings paper for more detailed information on these topics.
