and to interpret those results carefully.
So, thanks very much.
APPLAUSE
That was a great talk.
We have time for one lightning quick question.
So, in your first example,
you said that frequentist and Bayesian interpretations
gave different odds.
Isn't that something that a frequentist would say
is empirically testable by running the game over and over again
and finding out how many happen in this situation?
Yeah, the question was,
in the first example of frequentism
and Bayesianism give different odds,
and can't we empirically test that in a frequentist manner?
The answer is yes, and it confirms the Bayesian results correct.
But that Bayesian result is correct
only if you have the prior correct.
So, this is the detail that I sort of glossed over.
The choosing of the prior and the Bayesian analysis
can have some real subtleties,
and if you don't choose it correctly,
you might end up biasing your results.
And I have, in the proceedings paper,
I have some references for that
where you can read a little bit more.
But that's the one thing that you have to be careful about,
is the prior and Bayesianism.
