Processing Overview for IEEE SPS Autonomous System Initiative
============================
Checking IEEE SPS Autonomous System Initiative/Active Inference (Prof. K.Friston).txt
1. The question about how the brain scales up action spaces in a model like OPTIMAL (Optimal Control with Transient Information) was addressed by Professor Tomaso, who explained that in biological systems, this scaling is achieved in parallel, not sequentially. This means the brain simultaneously considers a vast number of potential actions, particularly in the context of visual attention and eye movements.

2. The concept of a latent action space at different levels was discussed, with an example from the simulated reading task that involved both low-level (micro saccades to look at different letters) and high-level (jumping to the next word) actions. It's likely that our brains also operate with different levels of actions, where higher-level actions can influence lower-level motor or autonomic systems.

3. The discussion touched upon control theory and how continuous movements might be generated through a series of fixed points or attractors in discrete epochs of updating. This approach allows for the prediction and generation of trajectories without prescribing a complete path, which is practical for both biological systems and robotics.

4. The idea of combining continuous dynamics with discrete actions was highlighted as an important area for future research, potentially using concepts like heteroclinic cycles and the algebras that live in discrete state spaces to better understand and generate continuous dynamics.

5. The session concluded with warm wishes for Christmas and thanks to all who attended for engaging in the conversation about perception-action dynamics in both biological and artificial systems.
