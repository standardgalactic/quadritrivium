but you can also install iJulia
let me just show you here
so I would go on this side
and say add iJulia
execute that and then
we could say using iJulia
and once we say that we can just call the notebook
as a function
and that's going to open a Jupyter Notebook for us
so iJulia is going to
install
all its dependencies
well I should actually just put that in uppercase
that's the correct one iJulia
the i in the jr uppercase
and you can use Julia Notebooks
so you can code right inside of
Atom
you can code inside of Visual Studio Code
or you can code right inside
of Jupyter Notebooks whatever your preference is
so Atom
comes with Jupyter Computing
i should say Julia Computing
when you install Julia Computing
you're going to get this as your default
IDE
and it really is a lovely IDE
to code in. I hope you enjoyed that video
like, subscribe and comment
if something wasn't clear let me know
I can perhaps
spend some more time and explain that
otherwise spread the word
it is really easy language to use
it is beautiful, a lot of speed
of course with the size of datasets
that we commonly work with
in inferential statistics when it comes to medicine
we don't really need that speed
but it's just such a lovely language
to use and learn
that I don't see
any reason why you shouldn't
spend a couple of days and weeks
to get yourself familiar with this
lovely language
I hope you enjoyed this video
see you in the next one
bye
