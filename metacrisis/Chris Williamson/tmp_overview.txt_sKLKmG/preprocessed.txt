Checking Chris Williamson/Daniel Schmachtenberger - Building Better Sensemaking ｜ Modern Wisdom Podcast 348.txt
 In this episode, Daniel Burger discusses the potential for creating new civilizations, both ground-up and as iterations of existing ones. The constraints of a harsh environment like Mars make inefficiencies more apparent, potentially leading to more innovative designs. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the problem space of our world to create innovations that can lead to better social technologies, avoiding catastrophes or dystopias.

Daniel is involved with the Conciliants project, which aims to help people understand complex issues such as sense making, meaning making, and choice making. The project seeks to clarify the relationship between imposed order and chaos and how we can achieve emergent order. This understanding could guide both existing institutions to reform themselves and inspire new independent groups to innovate in informed ways.

2. **Emotional Wholeness**: Daniel's closing thoughts emphasized the importance of embracing all emotions as indicators of what matters to us. He argued that a fully developed human state includes experiencing a range of emotions, including anger, fear, and sadness, which are expressions of love and care for things we value.

3. **Emotional Intelligence vs. Reaction**: While it's important to be in touch with our emotions, Daniel also stressed the importance of not being driven by them automatically.
