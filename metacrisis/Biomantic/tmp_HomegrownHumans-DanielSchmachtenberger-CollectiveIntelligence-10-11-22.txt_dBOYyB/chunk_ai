meaningful now has to be the core question to redesign fucking everything because we're no
longer the best at doing most of those things and so it's not just the running out of oil and stuff
it's also the becoming fundamentally obsolete in lots of things but also obsolete it in the
shit that mostly we don't like doing and so then we say okay well let's assume that it's not pure
agi but it is um very smart ability to do computational kinds of stuff ai and robotics but
fundamental phenomenology experience human connection is still both intrinsically meaningful
to us and we have unique capacity well then knowing how to interface with the robot ai type
dynamics and how to do much more in the domains of what is uniquely human and we don't have to
prepare people for the workforce so we can rebuild an economy from scratch that doesn't say humans
have to work to get provisioned because that was only what we did when we needed the humans to do
the jobs and you don't need the humans to do the jobs you can also make it to where the humans don't
need the jobs and you have a different kind of commonwealth stewardship that also works better
with ecological boundaries i'm almost there i'm going to converge and close a couple things and then
now what my ai tutors are giving me has more knowledge than marcus aurelius's tutors could
have ever had but they don't love me they're not they don't actually really care i don't love them
and there are differences between the artificial intelligence and natural intelligence so now
my live tutor my live teacher is also talking with me and there's i just had the conversation
with einstein or jefferson or whoever it is and they're asking me what do you think is different
from what that ai einstein said and what the real einstein might say if he was alive today or might
have said back at that time so now we have to start to think about the way minds are contextualized
in history and the difference between natural intelligence and artificial intelligence and
the difference between hydrocarbon self-organizing systems and silica systems and what is intelligence
itself and what is the relationship of intelligence to sentience to life to consciousness so now the
human teachers are oriented to those very very deep theory of mind questions that once humans
start asking they go recursive on knowledge processing on intelligence and meaning itself
and you get these kind of exponential curves and can we have way more people being teachers
and way more developed in that system because we automated a lot of the things people already
currently do so can i have 10 times as many teachers who all get phd level training as
opposed to whatever you know current level of training they get starting with kids so the
kids get mathematical geniuses they both get a study with the you know einsteins and girdles
and whatever but they also get a study with people who have that level of capacity and
similar in the way that the da Vinci machine is already starting to obsolete surgeons because
an AI robotic surgeon is just going to not have their handshake so the the the doctors of the
future the doctor nurse role starts to merge more to who can do real human connection with the patient
and interface with the AI robotic type systems that do a better job at very specialist tasks
does that mean that we can develop people that have way more human connection a lot more so we
have a much higher percentage of teachers parents nurses high connection oriented roles way more
developed and way more AI augmentation of how we develop people to where the einstein and the
dalai lama become the median of human development yeah i mean to me on the conversations of like
universal basic income and those kind of things is like what's the question is always well what
on earth would we do you know we would be pointless or purposeless if we didn't have our work which
is very you know max vapor product and work ethic he kind of you know cultural conditioning and my
first sense would be like holy shit we would go back into childcare and elder care and art
and music and gardening and community and spirituality like like all the amazing human
things that humans have always cared about and there's and meanwhile we're outsourcing them to
bottom of the barrel minimum wage workers instead of making them central to our shared human experience
so that that tracks really closely with what you're suggesting so do i think that already
the state cannot check the market if the people aren't checking the state do we have to rebuild
the state to make that possible because it's impossible right now yes we have to rebuild the
state and the market and info processing and education and a bunch of things but can we already
have the motivated tiny subset of people listening to things like this say you know what i'm gonna
not default to the lazy certainty that everything is fucked because that's just lazy there's a
trillion possible solutions i don't even know of and in fact the people who i'm listening to who've
thought about this more than me aren't hopeless so maybe it's fucking dumb for me to go hopeless if
the people who know the problem space more than me aren't hopeless right and i'm also not going to
default to it's not my job i can't do anything about it's too hard to understand i'm going to work to
understand it and work to see what is mine to apply and i'm going to work to find other people
that are doing that and i'm going to work to try to be able to rebuild something like bottom up
governance of people who are really making sense of things so i want to see people doing that and
i also think that we have the capacity to be developing people with those capacities at scale
now there's a boot loading issue right there's some change to infrastructure and some changes to
social structure and some of the superstructure that all affect each other and take more time to
go into how i see that boot loading looking but when you're asking like why do i have hope
i was just wanting to play with a couple examples of how the same tech that fucks us can actually
radically enable us but the current market dynamics that are guiding it don't build that version they
build the facebook ai not that it would be so easy for facebook to do audrey tang's unlikely
consensus or twitter and up regularly all the things that a super majority would agree upon
and everybody gets to see what are all the things a super majority would agree upon and you run a
third party candidate that says anything the super majority agrees upon i'm going to run
block that would just start to make amazing change that quickly so it's the tech can do
different things and audrey tang just is liquid democracy taiwan right so for anybody's looking
to track that track her down yeah um so i think that the tech that creates so much power under the
current extractive and coordination failure dynamics leads to self termination but it also
enables fundamentally new possibilities that previous social and political theorists could
not have thought of because they weren't possible we could not do planetary wide coordination without
the tools to be able to do that so um so yeah i do think that if i take all of the failure modes
that i know of all the self terminating things i take the timelines associated and then i say
is there any path through this that is both feasible with physics it doesn't require
replicators and dilithium crystals and stuff it's like feasible with physics and it's feasible with
human nature and assuming we condition people differently but i don't have to assume that
everyone has an iq of 2000 and are omnibenevolent to begin with yes i absolutely believe there are
models that are adequate that are both possible with physics and possible with human nature
i believe they're threading the eye of a needle i believe there are way more ways it fails but i
believe that the likelihood for it to succeed is the people who are oriented to how we make it to
the eye of the needle and dedicate their whole lives not to ask the question do we or not but how
does my life increase the likelihood that it does beautiful so yeah that that notion of leaving
space for grace right the idea that there's there is there is always that miracle element and
kevin kelly has that beautiful quote where he's like it's way easier to imagine the devil than god
because of basically second law of thermodynamics but yeah everything awesome from the flowers to
you and me are highly improbable and we have to get better at believing in the improbable
yeah and and feeling it even before we have a thing to believe in
and then the other thing is i don't believe that humanity is going to make it i also don't
believe it's not going to make it i know either could happen and my my disposition is not just
because i'm sure we're going to make it so i have that certainty it's that i'm sure that i want my
life oriented to what could help it happen and i know that everyone who's sure that we aren't has
unwarranted certainty and disconnection from life force yes yes and then so the other thing is i
want my life oriented to the best possible future but i also want it oriented to the most
honoring of life now so if we don't make it i still wouldn't change any of how i'm living because
it is coming from the like recognition of the radical amazing that i get to be alive for a second
at all right like i had this experience this is so fundamental is like i remember as a teenager
looking at a sunset and feeling this experience of like i would incarnate this life and go through
every fucking hell and difficulty for this moment because it's so like as opposed to no experience
at all ever like it's so incredible and then i'm like i've already had thousands of moments like that
and if there if i've had thousands of moments that are worth an entire life it's all gravy from
here in terms of what's in it for me right like it just keeps being this embarrassment of riches
that the beauty of life keeps happening and it's all worth it and that doesn't mean the pain isn't
painful it just means like i have experienced pains that were excruciating and i can't feel
them right now and i don't choose to dwell on them and i've experienced beauties that were
awe-inspiring and i do dwell on them and so it's worth it right and so there's also a like if we
don't make it i don't just want to be partying in the Bahamas i want to be in like sacred service
to life because i because i it's it's still i it's the only thing that actually makes sense
yeah beautiful well i mean and that feels very um resonant with the Ajna Krishna story and in the
Bhagavad Gita right some reconciliation with the impossibility of this thing and also um
that we're never off the hook for playing our part to the help and dharma is not a utilitarian
ethic right it's a virtue ethic which says the utilitarian ethic says i can calculate the possible
future states and choose an action based on the best utilitarian outcome except you and i both
know that we can't know what the wind is going to be 10 days from now because fucking complex
systems are unpredictable and so i want to do utilitarian calculus where i can but i also want
to say if i can't predict the future each moment is unfolding from this moment and there's a trust
that the if i am in the deepest integrity in this moment the future that unfolds from that is the one
that i want and so that's like a it's a fundamentally different it's not based on future outcome it's
based on a trust of what unfolds from the way this moment is lived and the Bhagavad Gita is just
like the whole thing is understanding that dharma let go of the fruits of action and do it is right
because you know it's right yeah which also feels like why Yoda can never like call like
apel corner pocket he's always like i'm feeling the force you know but like there's perturbances
there's things right but it is a dynamic flow yeah of a complex system right so so yeah um because
yoda isn't god right if you didn't violate idol worship it's not this thing is all determined
it's still there's great mystery and i don't know and the wisdom is not i know at all the wisdom is
i know i have a beautiful relationship with the unknowability and still how to live in the presence
of that yeah you know and and even i mean the one the story that um whether it's you know yoda's
agnosticism even though he's jacked in in total gangster he still can't call this he still cannot
call the shot right but though the one that um yeah i may noodle on this more but is it's the
note like for me it's it's the lord of the rings and just the the genius of the ending right the
golem is the enemy and he is corrupt and corrupt and you think oh is he going to be savable is he
going to come back to schmigel and he does that whole schizophrenic chinatown you know back and
forth right and and it's not that he's redeemed in the end and sam wants to kill him and Gandalf's
like hold man you we don't know what part he has yet to play and then in the end it's not that he's
redeemed and comes over to team good guy he actually descends into his most corrupted self does the
he folds where he has folded many times before great you know bites the ring off Frodo's finger
and that is how it ends up in mount doom and destroyed so you're sort of like and that's what
i mean about the the space for grace right we don't know and i feel like you're echoing that
really strongly we cannot with certainty predict what happens next and if i'm hearing you right
what you're saying is the only thing i can do is act from virtue act from love act from defensive
and and and and bearing witness to life in this moment and the next moment and the next and perhaps
right if there is a path to salvation if there is a path to redemption it lies that way
and and we cannot see it from here but if but if we keep the faith in it that is essential
for us ever arriving yeah yeah totally and when the fellowship of the ring came together they knew
the task was most likely impossible and they didn't know exactly how it unfold and there was also
wisdom that guided that it was the right thing to do and needed to happen yeah all right so
before i fuck off and sail sail west over the ocean at the end of middle earth i will i will hang
out i will hang out with you optimistic and rosy one it's weird to be you know this is actually
this is interesting nate and i talked about this recently where a lot of the people that i not
everybody i don't want to make any generalizations that are too sweeping but some people get into
being very good at like thinking about catastrophic risk because their disposition is that they
catastrophize like in the CBT sense of like running worst case shit all the time in their own
personal life but then smart and they end up the good side the gift of that is that they're able
to think about how could this tech really mess stuff up and how could this agreement get fucked up
and how could this be gamed and um but it's also that that's the gift of it but there that
disposition is not oriented to find solutions it's oriented to find what's wrong with any possible
solution i was talking with a different friend the other day and i'm like look every time i tell
you a new possible catastrophic risk you without a lot of rigorous analysis you just believe me
that that's probably gonna happen and every time i tell you a possible solution you're like what's
wrong with that what's wrong with that until you find something possibly wrong with it that's a bias
you're running because why don't you wonder what could be why don't you just as rigorously analyze
the catastrophic risk of why that probably won't happen there's a and so i and if one is oriented
to catastrophize they won't coordinate with other people for shit because they'll catastrophize the
relationships and assume that everyone is fucking them and just doing it for game
theoretic power just virtue signaling and everything else and so you actually have to overcome
catastrophizing in one's own self to actually be in service to catastrophe as well to be able
to think through them and yet be oriented to solutions and oriented to collaborate with other
people so it's weird to be in a place of like no we really want to understand all the things that
are fucked so we can address them but it is so we can address them and that's both the show we
not so I and the address rather than just leaving. Takes a village to save a planet.
This was fun Jamie this was really fun today. Yeah yeah yeah well listen so so for everybody
listening you probably don't need any introductions or reminder to Daniel and his body of work and his
relentlessly good hearted contribution to finding ways forwards but I would super
encourage everybody that we will include in the show notes a bunch of the different references
that you made potentially to that tutoring paper you had mentioned another one towards the end we
can kind of go back and and all the ones I can remember. That sounds great and then just just
an encouragement that out of all of this complexity the simplicity on the other side is for each of
us and all of us to find what's ours to do and get cracking and and share share the triumphs
and disasters right not just post wins but but also seek solace and comfort so that we can keep on
keeping on together and get super dubious of your own certainty talk more to people that think
really differently than you and really try to understand both what they're saying rationally
but also feel the internal state of the trueness of that that they feel and while decreasing
your own certainty increase your own rigor and work towards what you would need for effectiveness.
Beautiful well Daniel Schmackenberger Consilience Project thank you for your time my man. Love you
Jamie. Much love. Cheers.
