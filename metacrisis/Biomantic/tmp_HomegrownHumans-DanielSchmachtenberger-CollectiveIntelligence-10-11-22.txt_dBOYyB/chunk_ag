building models in the universe galaxy brain take your pick of you know what indicators you
want to describe it feels like there's a bunch more lone wolves than orchids right so so sort of
the lone wolf it could be cats it could be tigers line whatever but they need 400 square miles of
territory for themselves and they might come up against each other at the edges of their territory
and they might sniff each other out but end of the day they want to they they cannot become pack
animals coordinated pack animals they they will fight or they will retreat to the center of their
territories so what is your sense this is a goofy tea up to a very heartfelt question which is
how do we become more like orcas and less like lone wolves so that we can coordinate more effectively
together because on the psychosocial level that to me has been a staggering and saddening fail
point that i've just watched again and again over the last five to ten years and we're not even into
the hot stuff yet i think is external pressures get harder the coordination gets easier in many ways
i think you know you wouldn't have seen some of the alliances that happened in world war two
if it wasn't for world war two and so that's one thing i think when you're the specific people
you're mentioning are mostly not exclusively but mostly they're non institutional thinkers
or thinkers who are focused on the topic of what's wrong with our total global institutions
so even if they happen to be at an institution like fhi or fli or something like that they're
still in a different position than most of the institution which is they're looking at what is
wrong with the world system including the academy system the research system whatever so the people
that are most oriented to kind of see what is wrong with the system are probably not people who
it's different than the people who developed say inside of an academic system as thinkers
are looking for iterative improvement but not looking at it as fundamentally broken and thus
are conditioned in a way to be able to collaborate through peer review journals and through conferences
and whatever with other people in their fields so i don't i mean i would say academic collaboration
is also really fucked but the that you're bringing up is a uniquely challenging case
because i think anybody who is saying everything that we know is inadequate then typically if they're
oriented to do that they've spent a long time thinking about well what would an adequate way
so there's not some existing traditional frame they trust that they will say can adjudicate
our differences with each other or can give us a basis to collaborate now sometimes that's because
of a weird disposition they had to begin with i'm smarter than everyone i don't trust anyone i always
know what's right right it's like the woundedness of the gifted child based in a nutshell sure yeah
and this is one of the tricky things is if you have someone who's really smart and sees a lot
of things that other people don't see and they're used to every time that i brought this up with
people and they knew i was wrong i ended up proving that i was right and they have real examples of
that it then gets over generalized where it isn't true and they can't see their own blind spots and
where people give them feedback about their blind spots or whatever it is they're still sure that
they're right and that everyone else is miss assessing right so i would say sometimes those
people had a disposition that brought them into that place and that's challenging the other thing
is even if they didn't so one thing i'd say is what brought someone to the place what was the
generative process inside of them that brought them to the place of looking at what is wrong with
the world and how do we need to redo it from scratch if someone is in that place that the
process that got them there is worth looking at then the next thing is what is the what effect
did that have on them right independent of what what cause brought them to that effect what effect
did that have on them of looking at the actual real tragedies of the world the catastrophic
problems not thinking that the authorities have it dialed in trying to take responsibility on it
there end up being a lot of frustrations and and pressures and scars and sadness and whatever
that comes from that and then if they're if they're trying to make sense of that it's probably
because they're trying to do something so they're probably overwhelmed busyness wise so they just
don't literally have the time they need to model sync with other people um so there's a number of
factors that are involved um i i would say i've actually had the experience of feeling very
in hardened and hot okay yeah i've had the experience of being like at first when i first
started diving into the planetary boundaries catastrophic risk fundamentally new thinking
on governance economics culture tech etc i would say i was naively hopeful that everyone who stated
that they had those values did and would work nicely together in the presence of the magnitude
and timeline of the issues and i would say i was pretty devastated by bad experiences in that way
but then that was part for the course because i was just under informed and that was part of
learning and then i've also been in hardened at how many people who have spent their whole life
thinking about things are willing to update their frameworks and do want to work together and are
motivated for these things even if through some traumas also out of real genuine care and love
and desire for the world and how as things are getting worse in some ways i'm actually seeing
more genuine collaboration emerging so yeah i experienced both of those yeah that's interesting
as you describe that because i've had a very schizophrenic experience too like i'll go to
events conferences gatherings and it's usually one or the other right it's either oh this is an
irreparable shit show everything i was pinning my hopes on is is turning to ashes fuck i go home
just being like okay now i'm going to the woods but then they're equal a number of opposite
gatherings and where where i'm profoundly heartened and inspired and it's all and i think i mean this
is i'm just thinking this out loud right now but i think the difference is is the people that really
give me hope are the people who have put their stake in the ground at any level of the stack it
could be education it could be animal welfare it could be sustainable farming it doesn't matter it
could be pick any single spot they found their place and they're doing their pot and there's
almost always a self-effacing humility even if they're doing global global scale things and they are
just phenomenally inspired self-effacing humans and the ones that typically break my heart share
my gut so the ones who are holding out some inflated sense of their importance or their role
and just never get off the dime on coordinating so in some respects it's almost um it's almost
people overreaching for too much complexity too much scope too much mandate and yet they
haven't really put their stake in the ground versus the people who are simply going to where
they are most called and they are in in some respects sort of surrendered to their dharma
you know to that to that the part that is there is to do does that track for you yeah it does and
there is a correlation but it's not like a exact correlation so i want to add a dimension to it
that i see like when you were you said something about like where you put your hope or where your
hope is derived from or something and i i find that the thing where like where my hope is derived
is totally invisible i can't go to a group anywhere and say we're going to make it through the
metacrisis because of what i'm seeing here um because this person who's doing unbelievably
beautiful work and conservation of wilderness doesn't even know about ai risk and their
conservation work is completely earnest and amazing and has saved all these species and nobody
even knows about them but it's also not on track for all the conservation that needs to happen even
close and they don't even know how to think about that and they don't know how to think about a
financial system that needs to turn all that wilderness into paperclips and um i think of
joe brewer right down in columbia just just posting these endlessly hopeful but honest sometimes raw
updates on just trying to restore a little patch of forest in columbia i'm like thank you you know
and similarly there are people who i think are doing very good work on say an area of synthetic
bio risk and the fact that the work they're doing isn't that the right rate equations for what's
happening globally or doesn't factor some of the underlying game theory that is needed or
so i find hope in those things but i don't find anything like comprehensive hope where i can say
and even if i take a few of them i don't say this plus this plus this equals adequate solution in time
so the hope is more that like there are more things that i'm seeing that are
not sufficient but are necessary emerging in more places that the convergence towards
sufficiency is something i can feel but i can't see it
um well let's can we talk about that can we unpack that because because that was the thing
i wanted to end with was what we had talked about um you know in our prep call for this which was
what breaks your heart right now and what gives you hope and and i'm and we whether we've covered
the what breaks your heart we you could touch back on it if relevant but if not you have said to me
and and i you know in my most intimate thoughts conversations with my partner julie and and you
know and close close friends i mean i orient right to some kind of upbeat optimism even though my
situational assessment is fairly grim and you've described some long arc of history consciousness
cosmology something something something where you kind of have a rooted faith yeah that it works out
yeah now walk me through that the how and the why of that and then also because i just wrote a book
taking you know taking the air out of all hockey stick rapture ideologies how are how are these
convictions of ours that it all works out in the end not just blind faith right not succumbing to a
happily hopeful ever after rapture ideology of like and then some inflection point and then
we're all saved whoever's you know the elect and identified as such um what's the difference between
blind faith and radical hope and how do you and how do you steer your way between those two
and it's fine if there's a if there's an appeal to metaphysics is you know we're
just because as long as we tag that transition i'm happy to play into that space as well i don't
want to be just a reductionist materialist nihilist existentialist although i can go there
on a bad day yeah okay a few things i want to go back and say one thing but i want to
because i think what you're saying right now is a good place for us to end so i want to complete
one part because it'll be useful on the people who give you hope versus the ones that more
break your heart and and so i was saying there are a lot of people where i feel hope in terms of
the importance of what they're doing right the fact that what they're doing is necessary is is
effective as well motivated is any of those things that the collection of those things is not
sufficient there's still a big delta of what has to happen that isn't happening
i can't see the hope in a place right but i can feel something like a convergence and i can talk
about why i feel that but the other thing was that you were saying you know that there are people
who kind of won't put their stake in the ground because they have a self-inflated importance
of what their role is or i think there can be a correlation that those who are thinking about
more complexity might also have
special types of ego challenges because they want nothing to be outside of their domain of scope
they don't want to trust that anyone else has other issues that they that they need to have
the totalizing solution for everything or and or their work has to include and transcend everyone
so that they have the their work is the most important and so whether it's that they can't
trust anyone or whether it's that they want to be at the top of the stack of importance or whatever
there's no question that like certain types of psychologically problematic dispositions can orient
people towards thinking about the whole and someone can also think about the whole in long
term because of being oriented towards abstraction rather than the physical instantiation because
they're just pretty disconnected and disembodied and they actually don't feel real empathy they have
just like some abstract sense of utilitarian calculus or whatever right there's plenty of
reasons that someone can be a big picture thinker for not great reasons but that's not always the
case and i also think that some people doing that work well is really important and not more important
than people doing the conservation work or the vial risk work or being exceptional nurses
but also critically important and i don't necessarily expect them to have their stake
in the ground be advancing something that has some clear metric in some part of it it might be
advancing insight about why those other processes are insufficient but is still helpful for that
other field to grow or how they're interconnected which is helpful for those fields to communicate
with each other so i want people who are thinking at high levels of abstraction and i want other
people whose sleeves are rolled up working on things i actually want all those things and i
have seen plenty of people who are in a specific domain not thinking about the whole thing that is
a sleeves rolled up domains it still have plenty of problematic ego dispositions there's plenty of like
dark triad middle managers and major NGOs that are focused on the environment or animals or
whatever else and so i i just i don't want to have the sense that if someone is thinking about
things at scale and communicating that knowledge that that always equals not that important or
not good at collaborating or not putting their stake in the ground i think both are really important
and actually having recursion between people doing on the ground work other people thinking
about that theoretically across more spaces giving feedback seeing if their feedback is
actually implemented on the ground that type of recursion is really good and that's where
my faith is in kind of like collective intelligence and curves of collective intelligence that don't
live in any of the parts that really are behavior of the whole not many of them and what's interesting
is collaboration is possible with people's output even if they suck at collaborating
um they can still if they create artifacts if there's if there's bodies of content or
information that are then accessible in the public domain or right there there are some
brilliant scientists and thinkers who are impossible to collaborate with but who put
information out that helps advance collective intelligence so they have a role to play too
um yeah i mean to me to me i i even not jotted this down as this notion of sort of agonistic
confederate confederation you know and i think you and i exchanged an email
18 months ago where i was sort of like hey you know the funny thing is about all of our different
dramas is that virtually none of us would sign up for each others right we we sort of like i'm
like dude your conciliance project it's amazing but i don't think you're going to beat qanon
with a better wikipedia page you know or tristan you know working on the social dilemma and this
kind of stuff i'm like thank you that's fantastic i think it's it's tragically doomed and i think
we probably think that about each other's stuff but at the same time without a doubt right would
like we'll be fighting the good fight and scanning the battlefield at the end of the day
to see your banner still flying and we'll be deeply cheered and and galvanized if it is
so to me that that notion and maybe this goes all the way back to you how did we reinvent
democracy you know is is that notion and this i borrow this from uh john gray at london school
of economics but that notion of agonistic liberalism the idea that we're not going to
get to combine our consensus that any utopian singular monolith descends to fascism in its
enforcement and that can we tolerate the diversities of our dramas and can we celebrate the differences
can can there be a confederation of the humanity involved while there is absolute multiplicity
of approach um and can can we celebrate that a little more versus creating you know factions
and divisions because we don't agree on the 11th decimal point of our proposed solutions
i think it's easy to say yes to that enthusiastically at a superficial level and i think there's a
lot of devils in the details um because like the idea that everybody who is pretty certain
that they're right about something that history is unkind to their certainty
and that it turns out that they were more wrong factoring more things that were unknowable at
the time and so the idea that at least pluralism that can at least make us less certain about any
particular subset is good like okay sure i totally agree with that that said some people will have
relatively better certainties than others where the decimal point really matters on things like
like can we do like this is very alive right now can we do a limited nuclear exchange that won't
create nuclear winter and won't lead to full-blown strategic um escalation or breakdown of global
supply chains and that that's actually a good way to go or can we not do that the difference
that's not like one of those we can just agree and live and let live on those differences it's like
it um okay sure we'll go with your model that the nuclear winter doesn't happen go ahead and
let that many nukes fly no no no no you you fucking got your model wrong it is really consequential
or i don't think that ai is going to be that problematic if we let it out into the wild
because there's such good near-term market purposes i have strong motivated reasoning
to want to let it out into the wild no no no i'm pretty sure you're about to kill everything
and you're missing something really critical so there are places where there's this really
consequential and those differences are like can we just live and let live or is the consequence
of some of those things stuff that won't live and let live it'll actually have second-order
effects that are really profound historically we couldn't fuck up as bad as we can fuck up now
yeah we could do as quickly or as irreversibly so you can see why there's more of a desire for
