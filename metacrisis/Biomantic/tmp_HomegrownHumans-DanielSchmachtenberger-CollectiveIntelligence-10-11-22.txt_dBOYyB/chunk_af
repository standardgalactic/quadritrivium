exponential tech applied to ai applied to population centric kind of warfare and mind control so
it's all this shit at once right and that's the important thing most everybody gets overwhelmed
with one of them and then over indexes everything on that thing and but the solution to that thing
makes other problems worse most of the time sure but this this is this is the schmucktenberger
effect right like like listening to you and listening to your credible running down all the
threads and all of them being self-terminating my sense as let's say just as a listener right is
like i either slit my wrists or i gather my loved ones and i fuck off to the deep woods
because none of this is solvable given how we've done so far yeah i think it is solvable actually
and so thank you for bringing this up um something i find interesting in the current
thinking environment as you mentioned of everybody being kind of deeper and not clear
thinking rabbit holes one of the other things i've noticed is that it's very common for people
currently to go from high epistemic certainty to when that's challenged adequately epistemic
nihilism in one step like they're super certain about whatever the thing is regarding um covid or
climate change or institutional racism or whatever and if some and mostly they're closed to having
their challenge thinking they're they're thinking challenged at all but if you do adequately challenge
it including the solution that they have hope in because as you know that as you bring up people
need hope if you challenge the hey renewables aren't going to get us there in time to solve the
climate change problem because dot dot dot or whatever it is they go to i don't fucking know
what's true and but not like a hmm that's interesting let's work on that and figure it out
but like a give up right in nihilism and you can't go from certainty to nihilism and possibly
have any chance of being a part of the solution or being part of solution and you have to be able
to say i don't have anything close to adequate certainty but that also means i don't have adequate
certainty that the whole thing is inexorably fucked i i should i should not have certainty
about what the right answer is but i also shouldn't have certainty there's no answer those are both
unfounded and so i should say the unknown unknown set is pretty large there's a lot of
shit i don't know and there might be a lot of solutions in there if i don't know the problem
space well i won't even know how to recognize them because i'll think the thing that just solves the
tiny part of the problem space i currently know is a good answer and it externalize and harm somewhere
so i need to actually be willing to engage in understanding the problem space better so i
can recognize good solutions and then i have to be engaged in working hard to figure out what those
might be so i think the people like people's willingness to sit in not certainty and work
harder really important and that's that that's just worth emphasizing right sort of agnostic
optimism yes i don't fucking know yes right and i'm keeping the faith regardless faith is a key
word i don't think we have any chance without something like a faith and it's not a faith that
god will figure it out and i don't have anything to do right it's not a 2012 will make us all
higher dimensional light beings or jesus will come back and fix it or the new version of jesus
will come back and fix it which is the agi will become superintelligence who have been able to
and fix it all for us um those types of faith are totally pernicious and dumb and the and the
atheist movement get rid of them for the obvious smart reasons they're a child's faith right but
there was a kind of faith that every innovator had that a solution might be possible that a new
discovery might be possible that had them work in the presence of the unknown so hard to find
something and it's a faith in possibility not uncertainty not in the specific thing right
there is no such thing as like real invented innovative work that doesn't have a faith at the
center of it um and so i would say i don't know if this is exactly true but i'm i heard from gene
houston once when she did her did her phd thesis was like the helped kick off the human potential
movement back in the day and then she studied 50 of the top creative polymath geniuses at the time
looked at their psychology and wanted to see do they have anything in common that the rest of
population doesn't have in common that is developable it could be the basis of a future education
human development system and she studied bucky fuller and margaret mead and linus pauling and
jonah sock and like the fucking great luminaries at that time and the first of the quality she said
she noticed that they all had in common was that they all had an extremely positive emotional
valence associated with failure and you see that there's like a kind of sad superficial version of
this silicon valley has taken called move fast and break things um but there there was a deep
thing she said when she talked to bucky and asked him what does it mean if you're failing that he
started rocking in his chair and smiling and he closed his eyes and he said it means that there's
an intimacy with nature that i have because i'm working at the edge of human knowledge i'm working
on touching nature in the cosmos in a way no one ever has because if people already knew how to do
the thing i wouldn't fail i would just implement the recipe i'm only failing because i'm working
at something nobody knows how to do and there's something so ennobling and honoring and beautiful
in that and that's a different relationship to failure right and most people have and that's
what makes a bucky or a jonah sock versus most people and if we started to have now this is one
of those things in terms of like population centric do i think that those people rather than
representing extreme outliers on the right of the bell curve that we could actually move the whole
bell curve to have more people functioning in similar ways i do believe this and well dude
interestingly random apropos this is the new bucky filler biography
inventory of the future which just came today and i just i just read the quick book review and it
turns out that he's fundamentally like most of his the prior biographies are kind of hagiographies
by by disciples and this one is more of an even-handed one and it's just a very very
mixed more complex picture of bucky filler the man who turned out to potentially be a bit of a
kind of a gas-lighting womanizing cantankerous misanthrope as well so so just you know just
for us to all give i mean if nothing else right to give ourselves broke-ass permission to do our
partial humble fallible bests and not think that we can't all attain some of those qualities that
that gene chieftain was it was described because like everybody's banged up broken and partial and
still can make it make a positive dent in the universe yeah i think that's a i think that's
super important i do think i haven't seen that book i'd be curious uh be curious to see it
i had a i definitely had a process with many of my heroes growing up whether it was
mahamma ghandi or mlk or whatever that when i got the more kind of real politic biographies
it was less purely rosy than the thing i had thought and that was actually really good right
because of the point you mentioned that someone can be pretty fallible have a lot of damage and
still actually do incredible work and that doesn't mean that we should not work to take
responsibility to really try to clean that shit up in ourselves but it does also mean that we
shouldn't take the presence of those things in ourself or others as a limiting factor of the
possibility of meaningful contribution yeah absolutely i mean that that's why we kind of
playfully coined that term 80 20 it woke into broken like like the fact it will always be
in that that is our planks constant is just 20 fucked up human we will always be that and then
and then the plug i always make for nancy keen's book she's the harvard business school historian
her book forged in crisis which is detrick von bonhoeffer rachel carlsson frederick douglas
shackleton and lincoln and just these this really beautiful contrarian set of biographies of their
moment of crisis and challenge and why they're in the history books and that they were just
scared shitless flying blind going on their best guess and just the profound humanity
of these historic figures and how they shape the course of history but they did it from
incredibly humble mortal fallible positions that after the fact after that all the dominoes toppled
in the right way we can look and see as destiny or history and then sort of absolve us from being
part of that same process so it just feels really important to kind of ground ourselves in our
broke-ass humanity and willingness to try anyway it's it's interesting because
you know a lot of the people listening here probably are pretty interested in their own
growth as people and that's why whether it's how do they eat healthier and take better supplements
or do the right meditations and psychotherapy or study the right topics they're interested in
how to be a more whole complete person and part of the motivation of that is it's just intrinsically
valuable for the quality of life and how they contribute to their family but also the idea
that they will be in a better position to contribute to the world from there which is true
but it's also interesting to notice in those biographies and even more extreme cases with
Churchill and you know so many others you see people that contributed in really profound ways
who were like more broken than average right right not very personal development oriented at all
and there there is an interesting thing where like if if someone finds puts themselves or finds
themselves in a position where things of real consequence can be influenced by their behavior
that can that can up level of person in really profound ways and it still doesn't clean up all
of those things but it can clean up some of them and or motivate them to transcend it enough
and yet it can also end up having that all the good things you're doing are a little bit damaged
and polluted by some of the things those things simultaneously there is no end to the personal
growth work to be like now I have arrived and I can start making contributions to the world because
I can unwind my own patterns kind of forever so there is a thing where it's like the way I
orient to it is there's a sense of Dharma of how my life is connected to dependent on and thus
must be in service to the greater world and what is my calling there and how do I get actively
engaged in that and then a major part of my personal work is where is there shit in the
way of me doing a really good job and whether it's a really good job in my family or in my community
or in whatever the larger scaled work if I have that is and so it doesn't have kind of the infinite
solipsism of just personal work but it also doesn't have the working on the world in a way
where your own blind spots keep getting in the way and one thing I would say is
everybody has blind spots by definition I can't see some things about myself that other people
can see about me so if you want to not have your life if you want to not harm things that you care
about because of blind spots you can't see fucking get people that you trust that know
you will point out your blind spots continuously like that's one of the very best things I can
say is no amount of self-inquiry though you should do lots of it will give you the same
thing that other people's feedback can and this doesn't mean listen to everything that every
hater says and take it all to heart but it does mean buying people that know you well and who
give you really honest full feedback but there's an interesting thing so everybody has blind spots
it's really good to get a feedback mechanism and work on them it's not true that everybody has
defended blind spots in the same way and personality disorders have deeply defended blind spots
and that's the thing and that's their psychological trauma that creates it but I would offer
there have been people who've contributed a lot to the world with major personality
disorders because narcissism makes you want to do great things
um and you know sometimes external validation seeking is a strong fucking motive to do great
things um but bain and company the management consulting firm similar to mckinsey right has
actually they they've they've had explicitly in their internal documents seeking early candidates
on track for partner that are a little a little destabilized and have a little hole to fill
they actually right they want people who are seeking external validation to compensate for
internal relax they're going to work harder and or in you want that in the um executive positions
and entrepreneurial positions you want people that are codependent enough to not have boundaries
and just take everything you put on them in the employee positions um so there's there's a bunch
of interesting things there there's a very cynical but pretty true take of that some smart tier one
venture capitalist silicon valley venture capitalists that the main thing they're actually
betting for is not the technology but the intelligent sociopathy or dark triadness of
the founder they will hear out how to win at all costs while pretending that the real thing that
they're investing in is some kind of like takes making the world a better place yeah um but if
you want to win then you bet on people who are really dedicated to winning um and which is which
is externalities of the relational web like i'm willing to i'm willing to take the profit right
of my social capital and my exchanges and never mind the cost of an of a solid thriving social web
right we have companies set up to privatize their gains and socialize their losses that
there's a perverse incentive on the structure of the innovation very very deeply um but i was going
to say so that so someone can do a lot in fact there might even be more people who made the
history book with deep personality disorders than not that said that's where you start getting really
questionable there were a lot of positives and a lot of deep negatives mixed in with it so i would
say in terms of how you want to how people want to orient themselves and who else to trust because
everybody has some brokenness but those who are really willing to look at it want to look at it
don't give don't give very defensive reactions when it comes up and then take real accountability
to change it are doesn't mean they'll be perfect are definitely more worth trusting than those who
have a defensive answer or an excuse whenever those things are brought up and don't actively
seek and receive those well um and so i would offer yes except that even in the presence of
brokenness you can do meaningful things and wherever you get feedback about brokenness
really work on addressing it and in fact actually actively seek input from people close to you
where you don't get super devastating because you're like that isn't even me in my essence that's
a weird shit that happened in my childhood that's whatever it is me in my essence is the self that
wants to transcend that right that's to me that doesn't want to be an asshole who feels bad when
people tell me i come off as an asshole sometimes or whatever it is if that was really me i wouldn't
even be bothered or want to change it i'd be a piece of it the only reason i'm even bothered by
that is because it's dissonant with my true nature so i want to see it so i can take responsibility
to work on it well yeah i mean you gave me some feedback from that recent gathering where it was
effectively some some version of i sort of seemed like a not a great listener kind of add and and
and often changing the topic or spicing things up and because that i was like yeah totally that's me
and and i didn't there was zero i was like oh bring it like if this is it if this is all it is
i could take this all day long and i can for sure apologize to anybody that didn't feel
heard in a conversation but i was like oh no that's that's me without a doubt so you and i
made agreement as friends that if we had that experience with each other or if we heard other
people bringing that stuff up we bring it to each other i think that's actually like a minimum
requisite of real friendship like a critical thing is yeah i'll actually be honest with you
yeah and and and i am grateful for that i mean for me i always just think of you know physical
metaphors but like i i appreciate being able to bow onto the mat with you and train even at full
contact although i don't think we very rarely get to full speed but but even even relatively vigorous
attack you know for for us to you know train with and learn from versus where we're getting into
interpersonal challenges and let's just talk about the global x-risk sense making all you
know all the all the community all the communities that kind of overlap in our works um my senses is
we're terrible at playing well together and and i held out somewhat naive assumptions that oh if
people could only do circling or some other dialogical process or if people learned and take
fill in the blank of nv you know nvc non-violent communication nlp neuro-linguistic programs
circling authentic communicating whatever whatever we would all be better at it but it seems like
we're just all that does is just um make the obvious glitches in our personality structures
and or power dynamics and negotiations it just sends them underground and it just wraps them in
swaddling cloth and it becomes hotter and hotter to actually get to the heart of things so so um
i'm aware we're you know we're we're going into a lengthy chunk of time let me just check to see
how much time you have left because i would imagine anybody plugging into this channel
would be psyched to hear you you know hear your conversations um or you know and so i've got three
things left and i'll just choose whether we do three or we do one let's do them we're here okay um
so so the first then is um you know how do we maintain good faith and and i was just there was
some nature program on pods of orcas and it was just talking about how the orcas have additional
folds in their brains for social cognition and coordination so on the one end you've got these
badass apex predators they kick ass they're smarter than great white sharks right they are
literally kind of arguably the kings and queens of the ocean and super smart cetaceans big brains
and have extra folds specifically for social coordination we feel like at least when you
talk about the kind of quote unquote thought leaders clever people you know as burger kids
