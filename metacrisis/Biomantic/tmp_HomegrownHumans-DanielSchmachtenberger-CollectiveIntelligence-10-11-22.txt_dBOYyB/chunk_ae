more foundational is either we just hop off one sinking iceberg to land on the next as far as the
foundations of our energy economies or we suffer a population collapse of truly horrifying proportions
because if you look at all the population because they all hit the hockey stick mid-19th century
and and we're at a billion people at 1800 we're at eight billion has doubled in mine in your lifetime
so surely you take away npk fertilizers you take away genetically modified crops you take away
overtapped groundwater which is an you know I think Nate even used to have fossil aquifers
just I think just to indicate non-renewable millions of years to recharge kind of thing
are we not looking at a Malthusian horror show when and if we simply run out of oil
I think oil is a really good center point there are a few other ones that are not reducible to
oil when you are mentioning npk and Sri Lanka's issue there and what that did to population
obviously npk started with N just Harbor Bosch method and nitrogen fertilizer and we went
which was rocket which was rocket engine stuff for the Nazis for anybody planning along at home
that's wild military industrial complex shit but we went from I mean the green revolution
agriculturally in that way was as deep a part of the thing we can think of as like the beginning
of industrial revolution as using hydrocarbon energy it was used hydrocarbon energy and make
soil radically more productive in areas that it wasn't productive and productive for a very
narrow set of purposes meaning caloric consumption to grow open sustained populations so we went from
about a half a billion people at the beginning of that curve for the you know like however
three million years since the early things we call humans in hundred thousand years of current ones
ever to get to half a billion people and then half a billion to eight billion largely as the
result of being able to extract nutrients from soil faster than they replenish themselves
and those all that nitrogen of course also equals nitrogen affluent as it flushes out which
equals dead zones in the ocean which is very close to a catalytic tipping point level of being able
to make life inhospitable for any large number of people and so what we're looking at is we haven't
our economics has oriented to have everybody oriented to benefit themselves
where they will extract unrenewably and they will pollute unrenewably maximize extraction and
externality and the entire market system is oriented around maximizing extraction and
externality right maximizing profit the profit is an extractive measure revenue minus expense
how much you get out of the system more than you put into this is supposed to be a measure of
productivity how much did you add in terms of the value of putting those parts together but of
course that's not a suit that's not factoring that nature has a valent sheet and so it's very
important to understand that profit is as much a measure of extraction as it is of production and
we have to be we have to think about that more realistically it's like the Tolstoy quip in
Anna Karenina where she says behind every great fortune lies a theft yeah if you written writ
large right across our civilization you could make the case that behind you know behind our
abundance simply lies just externality so the Georgia guide stones were where I don't know
what the fuck happened they were blown up recently but you remember they said maybe a population of
half a billion that's the pre-hubberbush level of the you know that that was the pre-industrial
agriculture level of global population so some people look at it and say how many people can
the earth support sustainably well the most we empirically know is maybe around that number
no of course technology technology can create efficiencies they could make that number higher
but does it make it eight billion does it make it the projected numbers we're going to
those are very important real questions but let's also look at other fundamental stuff so we're
looking at energy but then the energy is mostly now moving some bits around in the digital world
but mostly moving atoms around in the physical world and it's important to understand that
where everybody's focused on we can keep growing GDP forever without hurting the earth because it'll
all be digital value now that's a nonsense idea because the digital infrastructure runs on a
physical infrastructure you need to do a lot of rare earth mining to make all of the computer chips
and you need to use a lot of energy to run the server farms and all that kind of stuff and ultimately
there's only people have a finite amount of time and attention to engage in content online and so
you do end up getting a diminishing return on how much like what how much of the economy can be
purely digital relative to the bits part relative to the energy and atoms part yeah we don't get
to eat we and we live in these meat suits and they are in 3d irreducibly so in the same way that we
have an issue on energy we also have a fundamental issue of atoms is that all of the atoms in the
materials economy are coming from unrenewable extraction and creating pollution and waste
unrenewably on the other side and so to close those atomic loops where all the new stuff comes
from old stuff and none of the old stuff turns into unrenewable waste or pollution and that the
energy required to run that closed loop cycle is sustainable energy those are like the beginning
requirements for the materials economy of how we live in relationship with the planet and of course
the closed loop means not only not just the minerals needed to make stuff but also that the
process of that acquisition is not destroying the species extinction and biodiversity loss and
like the biosphere that we inhabit what it so when you are energy informed or you're kind of like
biodiversity informed or you're like closed-loop materials economy pollution etc informed those
all look bad I mean I did read somewhere that we're only like someone was talking about closed
loop renewables and battery recycling right to just to just electrify all of our transport and
they were saying we're only at something like a quarter of the extracted and converted stock
of batteries to be able to be in that reach so we still need to do like three to four x more
mining before we even have the stock to engage in indefinite recycling demand amount of today not
at the demand amount of three to four years from now on an exponential growth curve up okay well
so so talk to me about because one of the things yeah yeah and one of the things that Peter Zion
for anybody following along that that book the end of the world is just the beginning which
came out a couple of months ago this kind of kick hit public saturation one of his major
tubs to thump is demographics right what is happening to the aging of populations everywhere
around the world in particular hottest hit probably China basically his thesis is the
faster you modernized the basically the steeper the cliff so England took four generations Germany
took three japan took two so they've all got some buffered edges to their demographic codes but the
the asian tigers the china crazy ramp up of the post you know obviously isolated communist era
those guys are all just running off the cliff and a billion chinese are going to be 600 million
within a few decades and then that completely erodes the worker capacity the economic output
gdp etc etc and potentially even the viability of all of these nation states um elon musk has been
you know tweeting about this of course it's mostly not been taken in context to get sensationalized
with he's having all these babies with all these women and that kind of stuff but but how do you
reconcile those because to me when when elon's like we should have more babies i think what he's
really saying is we should have more super genius montessori kids and less poor starving kids in
sub-saharan africa right i mean i'm absolutely putting words in his mouth they may not be right
but when you've got a demographic critique like zions and you know just think of yourself as the
ccp or anybody any government you know sweden i think where somebody in scandinavia is actually
trying to sponsor dirty weekends for couples like literally will pay for you if you conceive
over the weekend because our demographics are tanking as well so it's clearly a you know almost
national security issue of how do we have more people to keep this train going how do you reconcile
that with the flip side what we just talked about which is potentially that a stable carrying
capacity of this planet absent excess fossil fuel you know wattage is half a billion a billion to
take your pick but somewhere radically less than what we're talking about now and it's clearly based
on near decimation not extension or expansion of our global population because it just feels to me
like the people who are focusing on each one on including the other perspective correct the
when you make a system that is dependent you make a global system or would we then depend
upon it but it is dependent on a unrenewable process you're gonna have a problem because at a
certain point to substrate that that system is depending upon says the system has to change and
yet we've made a lot of other things dependent upon that system and that's what we have in a lot
of ways right now we we can't not keep growing global GDP exponentially with our financial
system being what it is because where it was it was supposed to be that there were goods and
services that were exchanged and then we figured out a way to make an amount of currency that
indexed the value of goods and services it's very hard to figure out exactly how many goods and
services are being created so at a certain point you get central banks and a Bretton Wood monetary
system and you just basically say the financial system now has its own mechanics people are
lending money whether it's just putting in a savings account and the bank does that or
it's traditional that or whatever they need interest on that money back because they're
they're letting someone else use their productive capacity rather than use it themselves in which
case they would grow it so the financial system now has its own physics where it has to grow
just to keep up with interest not also factoring the other reasons it has to grow in terms of
more advanced types of debt and and money printing and things like that but just to keep up with
interest compounding interest means you get an exponential growth curve to not deflate the
value of that currency that means you have an exponential demand on the physical earth which
both means energy and raw materials and given that that's been coupled to population that also
means a continued demand on the people being able to do the people parts of that material economy
to do the people parts that's nice well if you know Elon talks about a factory being a cybernetic
system ultimately this whole thing is a cybernetic system where it's the tools are complicated not
complex they don't make themselves but it just defines cybernetic system a complex control system
that like an artificial control system that in this case involves human elements and technological
coordination of those human elements and so as soon as you realize the people make the tools the
tools don't make themselves they're not self-replicating the way that animals or people or plants are
but the people make the tools and then the tools predispose patterns of human behavior to get them
to make more tools because the people who make and use the tools get ahead relative to the ones
who don't so then everybody has to and etc so the people make the tools the tools end up controlling
patterns of human behavior that system as a whole that is the tool human system that the tech stack
human system is a complex cybernetic system and Nate calls it the superorganism Benjamin Bratton
calls it the stack you know we've called it the paperclip maximizer or moloc but it so since humans
are part of that cybernetic system and that cybernetic system has an embedded growth obligation
our friend Eric Weinstein's term that he popularized they're embedded a growth obligation to
exponentiate its output you need an exponentiation of the population well that was easy because it
was being built on a time where the population was growing exponentially but then you required
exponential growth of all those things and you get to a place where the limits of growth which is
why that was a good term for that book back in the day the limits of growth don't let it keep doing
that thing but now what would it mean to have a financial system or a way of mediating exchange
of value and property rights and access to things that doesn't involve interest we would
we don't know anything that is like would is there's nothing in play to change that currently
and so yeah where's Bono when you need him we just need forget Africa we need global debt
forgiveness we just need a quick reset and now before the removal of Glass-Steagall that might
have seemed like a good idea right before radical deregulation because the idea hey there's radical
wealth inequality it must be all of the like super duper billionaires who have the money and
are loaning it to everybody else so let's just do debt forgiveness and only the uber wealthy will
get kind of fucked in that everything else will be better that's not true now because of the deregulation
everybody's retirement funds when we're talking about government employees and teachers therefore
a 1k is being lent out and so if you do that debt jubilee everyone's retirement is gone
and they don't know how to run their life and work as old people and so the system is really set up
to be hard to change yeah well listen i want to talk to you about this because a this is deep
nerd so anybody listening along we are in deep nerd land and and i i mean i i love it and i love
to get to ask you the kind of questions i don't get to ask too many folks um and if you know um
there's that film that came out on netflix it's one of david akbers like a couple of years ago
called breaking boundaries and it's a complete departure from his normal look at all the pretty
animals and it's with yoan rocstrom uh rocstrom from the potsdam climate institute which is arguably
one of the most credible um you know institutions in that space and and rocstrom is basically just
describing you know nine parameters or whatever it is around the world tipping point kind of
you know gauges to be watching and where do we stand in each of them and and and he then came
and presented to our friends amary levins and the rocky mountain institute folks and one of his and
therefore rmi's assumptions as of last year i think was we are effectively going over the falls
in the barrel we came in and so much of your critiquing analysis is this is self terminating
this is self terminating that's self terminating these are all inescapable generator functions
of demise the only solutions are for us to reinvent education reinvent capitalism or economies
reinvent politics and governance so run the thought experiment with me i hear what you're saying
and you know the logic is fairly tight other than humans have always muddled along with these
imperfect situations and conditions and institutions but if you take that we're going over the falls
in the barrel we came in what's your prognostication like we are who we are we have our goofy dysfunctional
captured government we have our wacky inflation incentive economics we are who we are we are
products of our time and place and the inertia to our existing way of living um exceeds our
trim tabs to you know to borrow one of bucky fuller's notions um ability to do this so what's your
sense realistically other than somehow having this confab of world leaders and thinkers that
just suddenly decided enough's enough and we need to rebuild everything simultaneously from scratch
right what's your actual sense of capacity to go over the falls in this barrel we're in
yeah so there's a lot more things that we should construct about the other
non-reducible things that are not able to continue that the system depends on
their self-terminating because then it gives us an even deeper sense of what has to be reconstructed
i i won't go down these rabbit holes but let me just mention briefly we were talking about the
problem of the financial system having an exponential embedded growth obligation that is
connected to a materials economy that where you just can't do that on a finite planet with a
open loop materials economy but the financial system also even deeper if you have your assessment
of value all quantitative and a single quanta right dollars then the value of everything that is
qualitative gets converted to quantitative what will the market bear and all different
metrics get converted to a single metric how much of this person's creativity this original
rembrandt how many copper how much for this animal's life and it's all dollars so what that means now
is like the real question of can i convert tons of co2 into saved rhinos or less parts per million
of mercury in the ocean or higher quality of life for old people or like no they're fundamentally
different things those quanta are those those metrics are uninterchangeable with each other
but when you determine the market-based value of all of them in a single metric then rather than
maintain each of them with their own accounting and logic that they need where you maximize
extraction externalization is where the logic of the dollars ends up operating because if i value
something that doesn't give me more dollars i lose economically to those who only value things that
are quantifiable extractable exchangeable then they have more power in the system so those that have
the most perverse value system end up winning and determining the system so the future system
won't have something like a single fungible metrified currency that's really fucking different that's
so different right because then if you say okay well we'll have lots of different currencies for
different things well if there's an exchange between them then you end up still getting one
quantified i mean one one fun thing so choose your reserve currency that that everything
it is scissors so that's an example again of like oh the the future things we're talking about
are really really different and there are so many of these and it's important if we're going to try
to talk about how to design a future because if we if we were just talking about these issues that
we've talked about so far regarding the global mega machine and energy and like that and we weren't
recognizing that we're within a single digit number of years from tabletop gene synthesizers
in basements which actually i think gets us to globalizing catastrophes faster than these other
globalized things do we wouldn't have to focus on regulating exponential tech that fast or the
