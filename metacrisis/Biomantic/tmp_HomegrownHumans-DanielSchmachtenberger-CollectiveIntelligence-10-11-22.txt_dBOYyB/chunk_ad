surprisingly thoughtful. I think there are principles of the architecture that actually
are still fit for purpose so a different instantiation a different way that they play out so like,
I don't know if you've had Alexander Bard on he has a he's an interesting thinker in these ways
he has a interesting analysis of the three branches of government and that most every system of
governance that was stable long term had three things that were somewhat similar, like structurally
similar to a judicial executive and legislative branch. I think so I think things like
separations of power are trying to get to something deeper, which is avoiding centralized failure
modes, either from corruption or bias and blindness, right. And that doesn't mean we have to do it
through separations of power, like we could do it through something like computational methods
that allowed the transparency on the information provenance through the whole system and insurance
that all of the information was being processed with all of the relevant epistemologies.
But that wasn't possible then so simply checks and balances on power was how you prevented
centralized capture corruption or failure. Say that last sentence again.
Separating power into these various branches was ways of preventing centralized failure modes.
And they didn't just do three brands like the mad the mad king idea right just somebody going
totally off the rails and having unchecked power, or even the emperor has no close situation where
it's not that they're idiom mean and they're fucking have really really nasty but where they are
in a distortion bubble, where they have a bunch of yes men in a court around them they just can't
tell what's true and the thing is failing for those reasons right. So the idea of like, a centralized
system can have bad intent at the top, it can have mistakes at the top, it can have modes of
capture at the top for others who have bad intent weren't currently there. So let's just keep it
so there's some type of stability, and the two alone can't do that, which is why the two party
system gets so fucked is it ends up just driving polarization. So you have to be able to have
something like this three body problem of it, you know, having them check each other,
and they do different things. It makes sense that the judicial branch is optimized for
wisdom that can adjudicate where the letter and the spirit of the law are different not
optimized for everybody has a say. The creation of new law is optimized to go slowly representing
everybody and the ability to execute really quick shit that has to be quick has limits put in place
but there's a branch for it like like all that was smart. But I mean I would say it's I would make
the case that the thing that Trump did was he broke tripartite government, right. So he had
an attorney general and he just replaced attorney generals till they did his bidding although both
of his choices were more than happy to the legislative branch went fully in the tank. So
instead of the Senate bowing up on him and being like you're you're the rhino bro and we're going
to let you know that what this august institution will or won't do right now this gets back into
information ecology and doing an end run around public opinion via Twitter and a bunch of other
things and the judiciary which most people while people were raised tweeting about you know Trump's
latest inflammatory thing you know he and McConnell were packing the courts top to bottom
they posted more court appointments in three years than Obama did in eight and now Roe v. Wade
and all these other things we're now seeing you know in creating McConnell's utterly cynical
stalling tactics of appointments and this and that right you're now we don't have a tripartite
government and so and to me that was the most concerning thing 20 watching 2016 to 2019 I was
like oh shit this is now a decades long hangover this is not swapping out the guy at the top
every four years and yay we get our guy back in or anything like that this is now a systemic
rupture of any of the checks and balances that you just laid out in the theoretical model well
so this is we're saying two different things and I think they're both true and important we're
saying that even if the previous system was well intact it would be insufficient for various
reasons and we didn't start to lay out all those reasons but it would be insufficient we can say
things like we don't have ways of ensuring that the representatives are representing the people
because we don't have everybody going to town halls and because of smallness of scale type
issues and we don't and the fact that you would regulate after the fact because of the speed of
tech being so slow it doesn't work anymore so there's like a few things where it's like even
if that system was intact it's no longer an adequate system or the thing like it needed a
fourth estate to actually function well and it doesn't the other thing is that that system
isn't even intact right that system has eroded profoundly and so both of those things are
simultaneously true because it's eroded so profoundly we know some major changes to
governance are necessary and I because it's even if it hadn't it's no longer fit for purpose
in the exact way it implements itself even if some of the principles are right
thinking about well how would we rebuild now something that is aligned with the right kind of
principles that both create the kinds of regulations that are important without the
kinds of centralizations of power that are really problematic and I don't think it's an unreasonable
thought for anybody to say if we were even the most like founding father staunch person
doesn't think the founding fathers would have built it the same way if they built it today
exactly those guys brought here like printing press wouldn't wasn't the exciting information
tech right um and given the total amount of information to process and given all of the
changes like of course this current system would have a much deeper digital interface
everybody can't fit in a town hall anymore but everybody can't fit in the internet to be able
to directly input on things and um we can make identity as secure as we have for online banking
easily right that's already um secure to be able to do a lot of things differently so I the idea that
it we have to and can start to restructure the thing very deeply um I think is a pretty reasonable
thought okay well there's a lot there and in fact that that fella that I just mentioned who's in
DC politics who just came to our recent event was talking about parallel democracy movements
of you know and the idea of people starting to sort of spin up alternate ways of governance and
you've been working with the digital and direct democracy efforts you've you've referenced the
Taiwanese um expressions which is increasingly acutely relevant right now um I feel like you've
been hinting at a model do you want to just play this through and kind of lay out what you think
would be optimal I'm imagining there's some version of blockchain validations and security
and anonymity underneath it or not um you know again banks don't use it so we don't have to go
that way but what would your best take be in a quick sketch of some version of digital democracy
and then what how on earth would you pry the wheel away from the entrenched and potentially
corrupt or captured powers and interests that are running the old system
yeah it's tricky if we were to say how do you how do you design an ideal system from scratch
even if you come up with a good design obviously it'll probably be wrong but let's even say we
came up with a really good design how do you do enactments and this is where a lot of people
like the people in the teal circle become libertarian is there like your utopian ideals take so much
violence to enact and the presence of all of the vested interests that don't want them is it
still a utopia after you committed the amount of violence needed to enact it um that's the
shagovara paradox right yeah exactly when he starts out as a starts out as a as a as a bleeding
do-gooder you know doctor on a motorcycle and ends up capping people in the jungle
for a reason that we can empathize with like the process that took him in that direction right
but empathizing with doesn't mean want to repeat um and
the other so the the other direction is not design a perfect system and then be stuck with
enactment problems the other way is what is intelligible to the current system
that could vector it in the right direction and can those shifts converge to a new adequate thing
the forward and reverse engineering approach and i i like to do both of those and have them
in or inform each other because i do think there are certain risks that are clear and
eminent enough that they require acting and where the forcing function of them can make
certain action occur they can also move us in a fundamentally different direction um
i'm biting my tongue because it will it will take a lot to construct some of these things
let me let me construct one other thing first when i was saying that at the time of the
us democracy and the other kind of modern european democracies were roughly in a
similarish time but let's take the us democracy obviously the critique is also pretty clear that
the the political economy right you can't separate the government and the economic system
those things are embedded especially when it's something like liberal democracy that's trying
to make the market do most things it uh it did depend upon genocide and slavery right it was
not a political economy that worked without the most gruesome things and then it only we can only
kind of say slavery ended when you actually really look at the history of the peonage
indentured servitude system following and like that but also it was able to kind of start to end
because of fossil fuel slaves because of the industrial revolution and then this gets us
into the nate stuff we were talking about earlier which was oh now rather than extract from another
race we can extract from nature radically faster than is possible to produce enough abundance that
this kind of system works this is another one of the ideas of why this is a short term one of what
like whitney calls the carbon spike a very short period of time where the abundance went way up from
anything it had ever been where you can have people happier with whatever the system is because
you're creating so much distributed abundance of certain kinds that everyone feels like well at
least it keeps getting better every year but in a way that is fundamentally not continuous and
actually self-terminating yeah well I mean and that's worth talking about right because it's
because all modern political theory economic theory I mean I mean Friedman Hayek the shi
you know the austrian you name it any and you did all the way to canes and and and new economic
whatever the fuck quantitative easing just print more money because canes was basically like hey you
you can't ever print too much money provided you can deliver on the investments right but there
was that huge key asterisk of provided you can deliver on the investment right and so logical
consideration on that yeah and and but all of that was within that carbon pulse so it was basically
like we were trying to do sleep and physiology tests you know when everybody was given an eight
ball to go you know to go home for the weekend and you're like okay none of this is actually human
nature tests on a big what it's led yeah yeah yeah so so one of the things that Nate has said that I
think is is really memorable when you're talking about slavery right because because there is a
there is a strong argument Yale historian Edwin Morgan made it American slavery American freedom
he's like hey slavery is a central prerequisite yeah for attempting the experiment of democracy
it happened in Greece it happened in Rome it happened in the United States it's not until
you get to the mid 19th century with the advent of coal and steam power slavery and slavery and
genocide it wasn't an empty land you had to kill all the people that were here oh and then massively
extract all the crazy abundant natural resources which were one-time bananas also but but his point
is is that just in like right now today we are enjoying via the fossil fuel bump the equivalent
labor of 500 billion humans to support 8 billion or really more like more realistic to support 4 or 5
billion max right and and that 500 billion effectively you know units of manual labor or
enslavement are we're borrowing from our great grandchildren so we're effectively enslaving
the unborn to enjoy our current standards of living and just I everyone might not be clear on that
the the fossil fuel slaves you're talking about are that if caloric units of barrels of oil yeah
that are doing massive it would have been human work yeah so if you were to replace all the things
that are running on hydrocarbons the automation that's already occurred with human activity would
take about 500 billion humans to do to run the current materials economy yeah it's like
what comes to mind is like friends if you've got any friends that have ever posted up in Asia
and they live like Rajas you know in Kathmandu or or or India or Thailand or wherever and they've
got maids and they've got goddess and they've got all these things you're like we're all kind of doing
that yeah there's something called the global slavery calculator I don't know if you've used it
yeah but it you basically plug in your lifestyle details and it's not looking at carbon slaves
it's actually looking at humans that are in indentured servitude conditions that are making
your iPhones and that are mining the cobalt for the battery for your iPhone and basically saying
based on your lifestyle how many slaves I think 27 on average for an average American
meaning that many not just the fossil fuel slaves but actual people in indentured servitude equal
types of positions required to make the supply chain that your life depends upon
yeah it's gonna break right that thing doesn't get to keep happening that way for a lot of reasons
and the reckoning of that is really significant okay well this now brings us back to where we put
a pin in the map with that initial thread so we kind of jumped into sense making meaning making
post-covid information ecology etc now let's come back to Nate Hagan's our friend and colleague
on energy blindness is his general take which is hey you've got to include where are we pulling
all this juice from to create the substrate of the society we live on and then of course what are
the implications as we appear to be getting to peak cub and slash the downhill slide on the other
side um if you ask me like as i'm trying to run the numbers and i'd love your input i don't know
if you saw any of the stuff on Sri Lanka right which has recently gone through political instability
slash collapse Barry vice did a kind of snarky this is this is the problem with woke esg goals
this is what goes wrong and there's definitely a whole information you know warfare on woke esg
right like the coupling those two things together um and but and i think her i think her critique
was superficial and snarky because some additional kind of energy scholars that i was tracking was
like hey you know Sri Lanka was a more or less subsistence economy dirt poor of about seven
million people they got they got the world bank imf double whammy you know like let's give you
debt and investment and then you stop growing all your food and you start exporting more of that
kickass tea you guys make and we'll give you more return on your cash crop to then go and buy and
import the foods you actually need and the population ramped from seven to twenty one million
and then they were trying to get off pesticides and this is a gross simplification but this is
kind of more or less as i tracked it then that you know lately they've been made a couple of
efforts to get off high petrochemical high nitrogen npk fertilizer you know turbo industrial
agriculture that then has created a crash which was also mirrored in in uh holland in the netherlands
with like the dutch farmers you know protesting lately and driving tractors kind of like our
truckers convoys all these things happening but now you're at a situation where Sri Lanka as a
government as a people are potentially trying to do the right thing they're trying to get to
more sustainable farming but they're already addicted to the heroin of the global market economy
and dependent upon it therefore to get off it is going to create incredible suffering and that you
know most estimates where that the natural whatever that would mean carrying capacity of
their landmass is about seven million people so they're looking at you know a 14 million person
catastrophe even if they were to try to get back to anything resembling a sustainable um a sustainable
arc for a caring you know for a sustainable population but now isn't that just us at eight
billion people like i what i don't understand i mean do you read peter zion's book the end of the
world's just the beginning right so like if you take zion as one thumb if you take nate as another
throw in buck love schmiel and anybody else doing this kind of big metasystemic energy informed
analysis um is it not it feels like to me we've got two choices right we can oath either you know
the cousinets curve of like greater technological advancement creating decreased pollution over
time it's a question mark i don't think that is established canon by any stretch you know this
the papers i've seen have said that hey that was true for western europe and oecd countries
it's not proving out when you test the asian tigers when you test a bunch of other post 1950s
moves in that direction but nonetheless it's either we find a way to successfully navigate
off the top of this curve of the the carbon pulse onto something sustainable and renewable with all
the caveats and asterisks about what sustainable and renewable actually could or does mean you know
with lithium ion with windmills with all the high embedded energy shit we currently call renewable
and can we do that without without a total disruption to our socio-political economic
structures and can we do it in time to avoid an utter population crash and the erosion of our
capacity to innovate further the einstein's thing of you know the fourth if the third world wars
fought with nukes the fourth will be with sticks and stones like are we not heading to
that bifurcation because to me that seems like the monster bifurcation like you've got surveillance
states and catastrophe and a third attractor which seem beautiful but to me even before that even
