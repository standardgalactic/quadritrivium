certainty but then there's also more motivated reasoning too much information and polarization
that makes it harder to get that well i mean i i think you know just even in pop culture right
you can trace this with black panther you can trace this with with the marvel universe like
like the anti-heroes these days and i think there's there's a what it's the sequel to the
davinci code i think it's called angels and demons and it's some tech bro who's convinced
that the world is overpopulated and we need to actually crash the population to save the other
half then Thanos famously with his snap wipes out half of the universe so that the other half can
live you know black panthers um i forget what he killed kill monger right his his critique is
effectively a black lives matter slash black panthers assessment of racial inequalities like
none of the anti-heroes in our movie in fact quite often the anti-heroes are giving more voice
to the current situation than the nominal heroes and there's been this kind of post-modern
play back and forth in our in our mythic mythic storytelling these days where actually the villain
actually has has run more of the facts and so the question back back to do we simply live and let
live you know a concern is if there's anybody particularly if they're decoupled from relatedness
from family from you know heart and their humanity and they're excessively in their heads and they
conclude there is a hundred percent certainty of a mass casualty event if i don't do something
then there's a whole lot of extreme and potentially sociopathic behaviors that they might see as
1000 percent valid and actually pro pro life over the longer term this is the problem with
like this is the biggest problem with utilitarian ethics there's a million problems with utilitarian
ethics but the and there's also a million things important about it i would say and this beyond
the scope of what we can do but i would say that virtue ethics utilitarian ethics and
deontological ethics all have a role a kind of complete ethics requires various of those systems
let's just talk about utilitarian ethics for a minute this bad thing is gonna like i'm i'm
responsible both for the effects of my action and inaction if i could have done something and
didn't and the bad thing happened i have some co-operability in that good that's fucking important
but you gotta watch out uh there are current inexorable bad things going to happen i can do
something that has some badness in it but less badness than the total badness that will occur
if i don't do the thing therefore i'm morally obligated to do the thing that has the some
badness in it that's all those anti-heroes that you're mentioning the it's not that that would
never be true right it's not that would never be true anyone who has made an act of self-defense
that was warranted and harmed someone to prevent their family from getting harmed did that calculus
and it might have been warranted right or a country that did or whatever simultaneously though when
we start doing it based on population numbers and limits of growth and IPCC calculations and
things where slight changes in the calculations do lead into very different outcomes and there is a
bunch of unknown unknowns that i'm not factoring that could change it radically the major problem
the utilitarian calculus is we we usually admit a false basis for excessive certainty of the bad
thing that is for sure going to happen yeah because i'm so certain that bad thing's going to
happen i am now morally obligated to do this other thing where i also have a false sense of
certainty that it will work and be less bad and so um it's the unwarranted certainty that's the
problem there yeah not the idea that sometimes you have to take certain costs to serve the larger
good um it's the certainty around those calculus it's not only that right there's also do i
wait certain things that i care about more than other things and whatever which which goes back
to what we were talking about 10 minutes ago about the wound you know the trauma of the of the gifted
child the idea if i've always been right but wronged right you know my tendency to presume 100%
certainty with my own models and calculations is going to be higher than if you what you were
suggesting 20 minutes ago which was its relatedness to our blind its relationships that give us
shine light on our blind spots okay return us to our humanity and potentially some more
humble um calculus if you have some kind of agonist federation as you were saying of people
that have some real expertise who disagree but who do trust the um process of deliberation between
them more than themselves my faith in that thing goes way the fuck up from any of them on their
own or from an uneducated democratic choice yes what is the right choice that the general
democracy would make about the safety of publishing synthetic bio information or advancing a
particular type of crisper like who the fuck knows that's not a that's not a late topic that's a
topic where the scientific knowledge is so detailed that's required for how to figure that out or
you're going to harden the energy grid well how much hardening do you need based on what the size
of the emp or the coronal mass ejection is and what's the cost of that relative to the opportunity
space the other things you do those are not good things for uneducated democracies but
they're also not good things for siloed experts with their own issues those are things for
combinations of the values of the general population being factored the realities of
planetarity and physics and biology being factored the experts and hopefully progressively more
earnest process and better collective intelligence with augmented computation being able to process
a lot of stuff that they can't and better processes of transparency and oversight to prevent
corruption so that the population does have a basis for trust in those processes all of that
together to make a better augmented collective intelligence system is necessary to handle those
kinds of things which goes perilously close to slitting my wrist or retreating to the woods again
but yeah now i want to say something about this the so the whole idea of our liberal democracy
we were talking about separation of the three branches of government but there was also the
separation of government culture and markets right that you have a market that has regulation
but has a lot of freedom to do its own thing so that it's not all government controlled
and that you prevent monopolies so that the market has its own checks and balances because of
voluntarism that that wouldn't happen if you had monopolies and you don't allow monopoly of religion
you allow lots of religions so it was a check and balance between religions markets states
multiple religions with each other multiple companies competing with each other multiple
branches within federal government most of government happening at a state level there's a
lot done to create a pluralistic type system is pretty smart but overall the idea is we're gonna
let the market do a lot of the innovation stuff and have supply and demand and invisible hand
guided there's all kinds of problems with that that are clear now that we're not clear at the time of
Adam Smith or even at the time of Anne Rand but I'll leave that out for now let's just say
the fundamental calculus is you're gonna do that but it's there would be a market incentive for
organ harvesting and cutting down all the trees so there's no national parks and fucked up stuff
so we're gonna have some state that has some law to be able to regulate some things and avoid crime
and whatever so we have a state that regulates the market the main fucking thing the state does
is prevent people from doing things that they have a personal incentive to do whether a person
or a group of people right so market type incentive stealing is a market type activity
meaning advancing personal gain of ownership through a particular process so the main thing
the government's supposed to do is regulate market type activity that only works if the people are
then the states watchdogging the market the people have to watchdog the state right if the people
don't watchdog the state and oversee it which is why it's supposed to be a government of foreign
by the people blah blah blah then of course if you don't have that then rather than the state
regulate the market the market captures the state and you get crony capitalism with a revolving
door between people in big ag and fda and blah blah blah well we were mentioning that the system
is too complex for the people to regulate this or to oversight the state to be able to see where
there are accounting errors and real problems so people a lot of people distrust the institutions
right now for understandable reasons i'm saying we need to rebuild the institutions in a way that
is fundamentally more oversightable and auditable and i believe we can but i'm also saying that we
we have to have a people that don't just bitch about a bad government while not being willing to
engage but who are like okay i do want to see what i really think about the models the IPCC is running
and about climate change this is a big deal i actually want to be able to have some sense
or i don't i'd like to proxy my vote to someone who i think really does i'm going to do a liquid
democracy thing or i do in which case how do i get educated enough and how do i become aware
enough of the biases that i can meaningfully engage where i don't become over certain of the
catastrophe but i also don't become over certain that the thing is currently fine and so this is
that place of how do we let go of the certainty that we know what the right answer is but we also
let go of the certainty there is no answer and we're fucked we orient towards faithfulness that
answers might exist and they take working towards and then we commit to the discipline and rigor to
be part of figuring that out and knowing that we can't do all of it the discipline and rigor of
evolving ourselves to work well with other people that are also doing it so that collective
intelligence of groups of people working to do that can enact solutions that is like the discipline
of a people that want to be able to reinstate governance of foreign by the people to say i'm
aware have you said that before because that feels as cogent a synopsis of your optimism
that i've ever heard you say well i don't know i've said it quite that way before but there are
reasons why i think that is possible at scale that would be stupid to think if it wasn't for
actual certain new possibilities that were not previously possible i'll say briefly i don't know
if you saw this paper that went around recently on why are there no supergeniuses anymore
the one about homeschooling about aristocratic tutoring yeah yeah yeah and um
noting that you've got a strong confirmation bias to believe that paper but yes go ahead play through
well i i was not from the aristocracy i didn't have aristocratic treatment but it did actually
give me some insights on what like norah bateson is a very interesting person and look at how the
fuck she grew up and you know our friend azeraskan is a very interesting person look at who he grew
up with and so it like it did give me so norah is gregory bateson's daughter for anybody listening
i don't know aza's background beyond his tech background what was his his father and then the
macintosh and was kind of the center like the the founder of human center design oh fantastic and
so aza's the result of that childhood and makes perfect fucking sense right but so what the paper
what this paper said and we can include it in the show notes here and then i went and i checked in
with zack and scott brick Hoffman and a bunch of educational theorists and um various of them who
done the research are like yeah this is like a third rail topic but this is a known thing that and
even charles sanders purse did a study himself to say because he was wondering why he was able
to make sense of shit across so many fields faster than so many other people were and he's like i
don't think i'm genetically that different like what the fuck
answers it so who are all the other people who are really really exceptionally polymathic what
did they have in common and he came up with the the main thing they had in common statistically
though it wasn't one factor was that they were all the results of some kind of aristocratic
tutoring where they had really exceptional private tutors when they were young and you look at the
dolly llama the dolly llama gets a kind of tutoring that nobody else ever has all of the best llamas
training the fuck out of you from the time that you're tiny yeah he was a punk ass trust fund
brat to start with till his tutors got hold of him and and so you're like is the dolly llama the
result of a particular educational model that just doesn't scale for shit but if it could scale
it would be very interesting then you look at marcus or ellias and the entire first chapter
of meditations is dedicated to his tutors there's a reason it was dedicated to his tutors is if
you're being raised in that period to be the emperor of rome the best mathematician the best
grammarian the best rhetorication the best historian are your private tutors and one of the
key insights i remember reading a paper many years ago that was looking at world-class mathematicians
and it was saying what is the statistical correlate we found across all the assessments of what makes
them a world-class mathematician like on online to win a field of metal or something like that
and it said the the clearest thing is that everyone who became a world-class mathematician the most
likely thing they had in common was that somewhere when they were young they interacted or studied
with a world-class mathematician and of course someone can try to flip the causation and say well
it was because they were so bright someone brought them there but it's actually the other direction
it's a very real thing which is the teacher that i get for math in grade school does not think like
a world-class mathematician about math they can teach me shit that's that somebody else figured
out but they didn't think that way they don't know how to teach me to think that way so i can get
the output not to generate a function right and if i'm with someone who is not teaching me how to
memorize a quadratic formula but is helping me understand the whole history of why it was never
understood and then how it was derived and why they derived it and they're the kind of person
that is derived shit like that themselves from scratch i'm going to get a very different level
of education and the type of general competence and thinking so it turns out that even up until
recently von Neumann and Einstein both had mathematician governesses when they were young
before they went to school and it makes sense that like it seems hard for me to learn Mandarin
but fucking one-year-old babies are speaking Mandarin if they grow up in China we're very
neuroplastic right whatever you're learning so they were they were like bucky fuller
terms that i was speaking as a little bitty baby because that's what my dad was reading to me and
so saying isotropic vector matrix and omnien or accommodative sound like fancy things but it's
just whatever the fuck a baby here it's a kind of a medic wait what what was the omni one omni
omni inter accommodative it was the word bucky use that i remember was one of my early words and
some people who were not bucky familiar were like oh that's a big word for a little kid and it was
like it's just because it was fucking used all the time but but it was also that it wasn't just
memorizing it it was a process of dialogue to understand what does it mean for something to
be omni inter accommodative that all of the generalized principles don't conflict with each
other right across the whole universe all of the constants and all of the laws of physics
chemistry biology etc are omni inter accommodative it's actually really great concepts built into a
word bucky like to do that but you could you could just call it groovy right i think that kind of
like doesn't that sort of um i that's what bucky called it after enough joints i think
but so you got this aristocratic tutoring model when we were trying to kill feudalism
because it was so unequal and gruesome and create democracy all the vestigial remnants of feudalism
where things wanted to get rid of and when you have a situation where almost nobody got a good
education because of course they were just going to be laborers or whatever they got some basic
guild knowledge of how to do a labor thing maybe and of course the nobility and then the aristocracy
got to pay patronage jobs of the best thinkers to tutor their kids it makes sense why you'd
have such a radically unequal distribution but you'd also get a certain kind of super genius
born out of that privilege but the thing is that's not scalable and you were just mentioning earlier
will these deep fakes be able to share all of wikipedia's knowledge or all of the knowledge
on whatever chemistry formal logic but also in the voice of whomever so now you imagine
the positive version of the ai deep fakes metaverse world where i go to the academy and i can ask
einstein and von neumann and kurt girdle to all come sit with me and have a real time dialogue
about formal logic where all of them are both speaking with the kinds of semantic coherence
to everything they ever wrote that they would have while simultaneously having access to all
knowledge of formal logic that has even been learned since they died and their ability
to model my theory of mind and pedagogically regulate how they communicate to my level of
understanding well that's pretty fucking phenomenal from a that's a tech new utopian left
10 but i'll take it let's keep going now i think we're only a single digit number of years away
from being able to build this and i think right now we're most likely building because of market
incentive dystopic fucked versions of this thing rather than the awesome versions could be but i
think we could do the awesome version now i also think that corresponding with that the population
lowering the reason why i want to raise the population has to do with trying to keep up
economic output of the people whatever but of course that's not factoring the technological
automation is going to obsolete most of the jobs both robotic and ai automation are going to
obsolete most of the jobs so then we have to answer what the fuck do we how do we rebuild an economy
and what is how do we rebuild an education what is even the role of education what's the role of
humans in a world where ai and robots are better than us at most things well what are we still here
for what are we uniquely good at and what are we intrinsically incented to do and what is intrinsically
