Tensegrity structures, which are characterized by a balance of tension and compression elements within their design, have proven to be highly advantageous in the field of autonomous robotics. These structures exhibit unique physical properties that include controllable compliance and versatile force distribution. This means that when integrated into robots, they can interact with environments reliably and robustly due to their ability to adapt to different surfaces and forces. Additionally, the shape deformations inherent to tensegrity structures allow for precise control over the robot's movements, facilitating locomotion in complex or unpredictable terrains. Overall, tensegrity-based robots are well-suited for applications where adaptability, resilience, and autonomous navigation are key requirements.
