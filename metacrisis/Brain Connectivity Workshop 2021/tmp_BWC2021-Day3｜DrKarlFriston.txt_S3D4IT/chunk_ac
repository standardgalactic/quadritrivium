of what gets sort of glossed over as you try and bridge different scales because i don't know if
there's been a solution that i've seen that actually can do that well without having to
potentially lose some of the um the richness if you will um that's within each of the levels
yeah i um i just make a few general comments to that which speak to the other things like
what has already been mentioned the fact that this group and the presumed the the audience
has a very diverse range of skills implicit in those skills is exactly this sort of multi-scale
approach so my answer to that was it would be to to make any of our theories work
then they have to be unpacked practically in terms of the neuro anatomy and the neurophysiology
and the empiricism and the mechanics and that's just basically our our day job um and what it would
what it would and clearly that's going to be a multi-scale and scale free aspects of sort of
predominated much of our this workshop and all previous workshops um um and you're one i think
once you acknowledge that then you've got your your focus is on basically yeah committing to your
scale but also committing how you relate to the scale above and the scale below and so that's going
to be done collectively it's going to have to be done collectively by people working all the all
the right scales so you know my sort of um platitude in response to you is well we're already doing
that literally uh but also specifically in the um in the attempt of this kind of workshop which is
to get all the different scales talking to each other sure sure sure i mean i guess it's just
question but the formalism that allows us to to to put it together it's not an easy task honestly
and i think you know i appreciate the sentiment curl that this is actually sort of a goal of the
workshop and it is i mean and i think the fact that we've had this workshop going on for almost
20 years that we've made huge uh uh progress uh towards that and it's just uh this is sort of the
next i guess challenge uh it faces us and i think we have a way forward it's just a question of
continuing to do that um as as a group so i actually think that's actually a good way to end this meeting
so uh dr breakspear would you agree uh yeah i um i was just looking through all the other
panelists and all the um speakers from the other days and um well our colleagues and friends so um
you know 20 odd years and every year there are new people and um hopefully all the new people
will come next year um i don't have anything wise to say but do we have any vague theories of where
we might meet probably in person next year so let me let me pass the baton to petra on that
and she's actually part of the group that's thinking about the next bcw right thank you randy
so indeed uh simon eichhoff uh claus h√ºgelthard and myself are the organizers of the next
workshop and we have already booked a building for that in busseldorf so the next brain connectivity
workshop will take place from 13th of june 15th of june 2022 in person
hopefully wonderful thank you petra that's excellent news i'm just going to uh share my screen uh again
huge thanks to all the speakers uh this meeting really inspires me because it does uh
involve discussions that are you typically don't have when you're sitting in your office or not when
you're sitting at your homes under quarantine or lockdown so i'm very pleased that we managed to
capture some of the spirit of brain connectivity randy one one one small comment at the end first
of all totally second your your thanks and it's been we've organized this meeting twice really
so uh we really put put this together a year and a half ago and then had to and then had to
had to skip last year uh one one thought is you know we've done this online for the first time and
as i was witnessing these these sessions there are some aspects of the online format that are
actually positive i think positive and perhaps should be retained i'm wondering whether we might
solicit some feedback from participants and other people in the community as to how should we
how should we think about next year if we do go back to the to the real world i mean one
default option is we just go back to how we've always done it but i but i wonder if some of the
accessibility and interactivity that the online the additional online format might bring could be
retained um to have a uh not a hybrid meeting but but have an in-person meeting with the capacity
of bringing people in who can't travel who don't want to travel or or you know simply you know
joining from from from remote places to contribute and that might be something you want to think
about and i i would say uh we should solicit some feedback from from from people in the room now
but also beyond and and see how we can incorporate that indeed a great point Olaf and just to note
to the attendees that we have a survey prepared that will include some information on that topic
exactly so we'll definitely be anxious to hear uh how your experience was and if this is very strongly
about you know broadening the geographic range of science in general on this planet
and not just limited to to people who are privileged to have the the funds and the capacity to
to to travel to to far off and sometimes remote locations so i think we really should
think more about how we can truly make this a global event each year and in in addition to
having an in-person component obviously which i think is much preferable in many ways to the online
format agreed so we will take care of this i think that makes perfect sense
in the pause in the conversation and since we have the thank you slides still up and Tanya is
there on camera i want to uh again express my sincere gratitude to Tanya who was basically the
lead for pulling all this together two times again this time in person so i'm going to clap
on my side but i think Tanya did a fantastic job for pulling this all together it's incredibly
smooth given the challenges so thanks again Tanya in addition Tanya is now going to be
transitioning potentially to a new job so even though she's been part of bcw
uh going back at least as far as Montreal if i'm not mistaken Tanya um it has helped
to organize at least three or four of these meetings so um so but since she'll be in
Germany next year she'll be able to come as a special guest if not actually a participant so
again thank you Tanya for your help over the years as well i appreciate it absolutely my
pleasure and i look forward to what's to come thank you um just a couple things like the
recordings will be shared i'll leave this up for a second people want to get the
the code scanned we will try and get or we in the oral sense we'll try and get the recordings
edited and up as soon as possible it's a very rich discussion so i like to save those and
in addition for those you don't know we are planning to have a special issue for network
neuroscience to vote it to this meeting i don't know all the details yet of who is going to
contribute but i know that people have at least in principle agreed to contribute and there'll be a
special paper from Carl Susan and myself that will follow from one that we actually did for the
first meeting what does the brain think of the mind and we'll turn it around now and say after
all 20 years what does the mind think of the brain so that'll be a challenging paper to put
together i'm looking forward to working with Carl and Susan on that and finally uh again
and Petra has mentioned we're on Dusseldorf so i'm hoping i will see some of you there uh at least
in person and definitely see some of you virtually so again thank you everybody for participating
and with that i will close the meeting and wish you all happy journeys and enjoy your weekend
that's coming up very soon bye bye thank you very much thank you
you
