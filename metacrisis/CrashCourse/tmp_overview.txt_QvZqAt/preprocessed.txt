Checking CrashCourse/Bayes in Science and Everyday Life： Crash Course Statistics #25.txt
1. **Email Click Rates**: In an email marketing context, Bayesian methods allow marketers to incorporate prior knowledge into their analysis of click rates, which can help in making informed decisions. This approach is valuable because it considers both data and expert opinion to estimate probabilities.

2. **DID Study**: Researchers studying Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) used a memory test with three groups: DID patients switching personalities, pretend amnesiacs without DID, and malingerers without DID who feigned not seeing the material. They wanted to compare the mean accuracy of memory between these groups.

3. **Bayesian Analysis**: The researchers applied Bayesian analysis to the data from this experiment and found a Bayes factor of about 4,000. This indicates that the data strongly supports the idea that the three groups are distinct in their memory performance.

4. **Implications of Study**: The findings suggest that people with DID do not merely pretend to forget information learned under another personality, as their memory performance is different from those who never saw the material and from malingerers.

5. **Applications of Bayesian Methods**: Bayesian methods are widely used across various fields, including science, technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). They are instrumental in machine translation, product recommendations, personalized medicine, and AI that understands user commands or preferences.

Checking CrashCourse/Regression： Crash Course Statistics #32.txt
1. **General Linear Model (GLM) Framework**: The GLM framework allows us to understand the relationship between variables by partitioning data into regression (model), residual (error), and total components.

2. **Sum of Squares Error (SSE)**: This is a measure of the variance in the data that is unexplained by the model. It's calculated as the sum of the squared differences between each observed value and the value predicted by the model.

3. **Degrees of Freedom**: Degrees of freedom indicate the amount of independent information available from the data. For SSE, it's the sample size minus 2 (n-2), because one degree of freedom is used for the y-intercept and another for the regression coefficient.

4. **F Statistic**: The F statistic is a ratio that compares the variance explained by the model (regression sum of squares) to the unexplained variance (error sum of squares). It's calculated as the mean square regression divided by the mean square error. Each sum of squares is divided by its respective degrees of freedom to obtain the appropriate means squared.

5. **F Distribution**: This is a probability distribution used to determine the significance of an F statistic. We can find the p-value, which tells us the probability of observing an F statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one we calculated, given that the null hypothesis is true.

6. **Hypothesis Testing**: By using the F statistic and comparing it to critical values from the F distribution, we can test hypotheses about the relationships between variables. In this example, we tested whether there was a significant relationship between likes and comments on YouTube videos.

7. **T-Test vs. F-Test**: Both T-tests and F-tests can be used to determine the significance of a regression coefficient. The F statistic for a single predictor regression is equivalent to the square of the T-statistic from a T-test for that coefficient.

8. **Applications of Regression**: Regression analysis is widely used in various fields, including economics and political science, to model relationships and make inferences about how changes in one variable might affect another.

9. **Understanding Deviations (Error)**: The deviation from the expected outcome due to factors not accounted for in the model is represented by error, which is an essential component of the GLM framework alongside the model's explanation of variation.

10. **Supporting Crash Course**: The series is supported by viewers like you through contributions on Patreon, which allows Crash Course to remain free and accessible.

In summary, the process we followed to assess the relationship between likes and comments on YouTube videos using the general linear model involved calculating the SSE, dividing this by degrees of freedom to get the mean square error, determining the sum of squares for regression and dividing by its degrees of freedom to get the mean square regression, calculating the F statistic, and then using an F distribution to find the p-value. With a p-value much smaller than our alpha level of .05, we concluded that there is a statistically significant relationship between likes and comments on YouTube videos, given the data from trending videos.

Checking CrashCourse/You Know I'm All About that Bayes： Crash Course Statistics #24.txt
1. Bayesian hypothesis testing involves incorporating prior beliefs with new evidence to update the probability of a hypothesis being true. It can be more efficient than simply finding someone with the same prior beliefs.

2. A Bayes factor is the ratio of the probability of the observed data under two different hypotheses, and it allows individuals with different prior beliefs to update their beliefs based on the same evidence.

3. Even if two people have different initial beliefs about something (like ESP or sushi safety), they can both update their beliefs in the same direction when presented with sufficient evidence.

4. Bayesian methods are similar to natural reasoning processes, such as a doctor updating the probability of flu vs. cold based on symptoms or someone updating their belief about a friend's kindness after observing more acts of kindness.

5. In Bayesian statistics, yesterday's posterior (the updated belief after new evidence is considered) becomes today's prior (the starting point for future updates).
