Checking Intelligence/Daniel Schmachtenberger, Tristan Harris - Can democracy survive social media？.txt
 The advent of the printing press was a pivotal moment in history that democratized knowledge and contributed to the decline of feudalism by enabling an informed public. This principle of an educated and informed populace is essential for democracy to function effectively. Media, from newspapers to radio and television, played a crucial role in disseminating information and fostering a shared understanding of reality among citizens.

The internet revolutionized information sharing further by allowing anyone to become a publisher. However, this flood of information created challenges for individuals to discern truths from falsehoods, leading to the emergence of algorithms that curate content for users based on their engagement and preferences. These algorithms often prioritize sensational and polarizing content because it captures attention more effectively, exacerbating societal divisions and tribal identities.

This phenomenon has significant implications for democracy. As people become increasingly polarized based on the content they consume, they elect representatives who reflect these same divisive views. This gridlock undermines the integrity of governance and can lead to a breakdown in democratic processes. The role of social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube in polarizing society is akin to an "oil spill of tech," where the negative externalities of these companies—toxic polarization—directly harm the functioning of democracy, much like how oil spills harm the environment.

In essence, the very entities responsible for fostering information sharing and democratic engagement are now contributing to its unraveling by creating echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs and prejudices. This dynamic creates a self-reinforcing cycle where tech companies become more powerful while governments struggle to maintain coherence and effectiveness in governance. The challenge lies in regulating these powerful entities when the regulatory bodies are outpaced and outmatched by the exponential growth of technology and influence wielded by big tech, which continues to evolve and expand its capabilities at a pace that outstrips the ability of governments to adapt and respond effectively.
