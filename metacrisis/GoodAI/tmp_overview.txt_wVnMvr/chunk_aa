Checking GoodAI/Uncertainty and active inference -  Thomas Parr keynote at HLAI.txt
 Certainly! The presentation you've described outlines a model that integrates perception, action, and decision-making using Bayesian principles. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Bayesian Model**: The model is based on Bayesian inference, which allows for updating beliefs about hidden variables (like the location of an object) based on observed data and prior beliefs or expectations.

2. **Hierarchical Structure**: The model has a hierarchical structure where decisions are made at different levels:
   - At the top level, discrete decisions are made regarding which policy (or action) to pursue.
   - These decisions inform continuous processes that describe how the agent's state evolves over time as it acts upon the environment.
   - The outcomes of these actions generate new observations, which are then fed back into the system to update beliefs and guide future actions.

3. **Model Averaging**: The model averages over different models or hypotheses about the world, effectively treating the choice of which model to believe as a categorical variable that influences continuous variables representing the agent's state and behavior.

4. **Perception-Action Cycle**: The model includes a perception-action cycle where the agent continuously updates its beliefs about the world and makes decisions based on these beliefs, then acts upon those decisions and observes the outcomes, which in turn update the beliefs.

5. **Extended Kalman Filter**: The model uses an extended version of the Kalman filter, which is a mathematical technique for estimating the state of a system over time, incorporating action into the estimation process.

6. **Biological Plausibility**: The model's structure and mechanisms are consistent with known neural structures, such as the basal ganglia and superior colliculus, suggesting that this approach could be relevant to understanding biological decision-making processes.

7. **Application in Neuroscience**: The model can be applied to understand how different areas of the brain might work together to perform tasks, with specific regions handling different aspects of the perception-action cycle.

The presentation concludes by acknowledging the contributors and thanking the audience for their attention. It emphasizes the integration of perception, action, and decision-making in a coherent framework that is both scientifically robust and biologically plausible.
