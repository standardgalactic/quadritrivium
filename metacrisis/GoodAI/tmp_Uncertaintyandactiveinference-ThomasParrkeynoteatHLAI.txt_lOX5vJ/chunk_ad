but with action added on
and then we pass that all back up again
evaluate the evidence for each different alternative model
which we can do fairly efficiently using Bayesian model reduction
and pass that up to inform the next step.
So we again get this kind of complete perception action cycle
so we can see how that might be implemented in the anatomy of the brain
and we've argued for some of these structures more than others
there's pretty good evidence that things like the basal ganglia
might evaluate the evidence for different kinds of policies
and behavioral trajectories I could engage in.
On the left we're just showing these
some of the inferences that happen at each step
so this is which the state's under each different kind of policy
which location am I going to look at
and I'm inferring those both at the present time
and at future time steps.
I then map that through with this bit
so this is representing the kind of topography
of the superior colliculus in the midbrain
and the idea here is that each location in the colliculus
represents a different hypothesis about where I could look
and this red dot indicates the error between where I'm currently looking
and where I think I should be looking
and you can see that as we form an inference about the next state
this moves out and as the error increases
I now believe I should be looking somewhere else
as the eyes move there that error closes in.
There is a cell population in the superior colliculus
that behaves almost exactly like this
so it seems again very biologically plausible.
Okay so that is the end of what I wanted to say
I just wanted to thank these various people
my funders and university and thank you for listening
so anyone have any questions?
