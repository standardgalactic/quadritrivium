I know.
That's insane.
.(audience laughing loudly.)
I think maybe we're gonna have to give up on this.
Okay, fine.
All right, let's move on.
Okay, okay, okay.
.(audience laughing loudly.)
So as I said earlier,
this isn't about Alex and I or random core.
This is about us as a broader community.
And we need to grow that community for closure
to continue to be fruitful
and provide the benefits for all these other companies
that it's provided for random core.
One challenge.
Closer is still a smaller language
and we don't necessarily have a huge marketing budget.
We thought we could help.
And so we worked with a team of professionals
and created what we think is a powerful
and compelling advertisement
that's gonna bring more people to the closure community
and we're excited to share it with you today.
Do you use boring programming languages?
Why does it have to be so enterprising?
Our static type's weighing you down.
How am I gonna get promoted if my code doesn't compile?
Do people recognize the stickers on your laptop?
I'm so mainstream.
Boy, do we have the product for you.
Introducing Closer.
Closer is a list that runs on the JVM.
Closer.
Immutable persistent data structures everywhere.
Closer.
There's also a transpiler from Closer to JavaScript.
Closer script.
First class support for software transactional memory.
Press.
Actually, nobody really uses press.
Adams.
It's easy.
It's easy.
No, I think you mean simple.
Simple.
Just listen to some of our satisfied customers.
When I cheat my copy,
I need to make sure it's not that many other people drinking it.
The closure fix my laptop perfectly.
Hipster driven developments.
With Closer, I enjoy using Emacs.
Emacs is intolerable.
So it's critically important when you're building software
to take into account not only the benefits,
but also the trade-offs.
And an important part of Closer development
is analyzing the problem and considering more than one choice.
All benefits, new trade-offs.
Everything makes so much more sense when you realize
it's just data.
It's just data.
It's not code, it's data.
No code, only data.
It's just data.
It's better to have 100 functions operate
on one way of structure than have 10 functions operate
on 10-day structure.
