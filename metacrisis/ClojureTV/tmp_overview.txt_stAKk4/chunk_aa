Checking ClojureTV/Every Clojure Talk Ever - Alex Engelberg and Derek Slager.txt
1. The presentation was meant to introduce Closer, a programming language that runs on the JVM with immutable persistent data structures and first-class support for software transactional memory. It also has a transpiler called Closure to JavaScript.

2. There were some technical difficulties at the beginning, including issues with the REPL and forgetting to include the necessary library. The presenters, Alex and Sam, handled it with humor, which was well-received by the audience.

3. The focus of the talk shifted from the technical issues to emphasizing the importance of community growth for Closer and how they created an advertisement to attract more users.

4. The advertisement highlighted Closer's features in a humorous and satirical way, targeting common frustrations with other programming languages, such as being weighed down by static types or feeling mainstream. It also included testimonials from fictional satisfied customers.

5. The presenters underscored the importance of considering benefits and trade-offs when developing software in Closer and highlighted the philosophy that data is king, leading to more maintainable code with functions that operate on a single way of structuring data.

6. They invited the audience to become Closurians and encouraged them to consider Closer for their projects, mentioning that there are trade-offs and restrictions to keep in mind.

7. The presentation concluded without taking questions, but with a call to action for the audience to join the Closer community. The tone was light-hearted throughout, despite the initial technical hiccups.
