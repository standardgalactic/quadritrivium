Checking Book Talk Conversation/Episode #5 â€”Karl Friston, Neuroscientist, University College London.txt
 In this conversation with Carl Abbott, a neurologist and author, Ben Valsler discusses themes of storytelling, the human brain's mapping capabilities, and how our understanding of the world is shaped by both individual experiences and the narratives we encounter in literature. They explore the idea of updating one's scripts and belief models in response to new evidence and experiences, a concept central to Bayesian belief updating in formal mathematics and critical for effective communication and social interactions.

Carl Abbott emphasizes the importance of having an accurate model of the world and the people within it, as seen in Thomas Hardy's works like "Far from the Madding Crowd." He points out that Sheba's failure to update her understanding of Troy's character led to tragic consequences. This illustrates the consequences of not updating our models when faced with new evidence and the importance of considering the power dynamics at play in how we assimilate information and update our beliefs.

The conversation touches on the application of these ideas in neurology, particularly in understanding how people with autism may experience the world differently due to their brain's unique mapping abilities. They also discuss how our mental models are influenced by the environment and culture we live in, and how literature can provide us with different scripts to understand human behavior and relationships.

Overall, the dialogue highlights the interplay between our cognitive processes, the stories we read, and the ways in which these narratives shape our understanding of the world and our interactions with others. It underscores the value of updating our models and understanding the scripts of others to navigate life effectively.
