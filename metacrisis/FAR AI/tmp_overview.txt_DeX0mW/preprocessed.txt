Checking FAR AI/Yoshua Bengio - Towards Quantitative Safety Guarantees and Alignment.txt
1. The discussion centered around how to effectively use priors in models to avoid missing out on important modes (possible solutions or hypotheses) and ensure safety without assigning zero probability to unsafe modes.

2. Priors are not a novel concept; they are inherent in machine learning practices, such as neural network architectures and regularizers. They help guide the model towards more likely solutions.

3. To ensure that priors are effective and include a wide range of possibilities, one could use explicit priors that can be computed directly, unlike implicit priors used in typical neural network training.

4. The application of these models should focus on generating small, self-contained pieces of theory, similar to how human scientists operate. This approach allows for manageable computational complexity and aligns with the way scientific knowledge is advanced through papers and experiments.

5. The G-flanet or similar model could be used to generate hypotheses about specific aspects of the world, which can then be evaluated against data to refine the model's understanding and predictions.

6. The marginalizer component of the model would be instrumental in answering questions by integrating over all possible theories, providing a probabilistic answer based on the trained distribution.

7. A sampler could also be used to propose new theories to scientists, acting as an automated brainstorming tool.

8. The presentation emphasized the importance of non-parametric priors that do not limit the size or complexity of generated programs or theories, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of the hypothesis space.

9. The conversation highlighted the trade-off between the computational complexity of exploring an exponentially large hypothesis space and the practical need to handle this in manageable pieces, as done by human scientists.
