to the middle of the smaller boundary units.
I couldn't see something, you know,
why can't we have in your final diagram
where you've got the 2 and a 61 nodes?
Yeah, everyone's right.
Why the big boundary can't whack through the middle
of one of the little boundaries?
I guess my question is, is there some story
given the build definition?
I'm not smart enough to see what it is.
I don't know.
It would be really cool if there was a reason
why that had to be the case, but it isn't.
Then the whole world opens up and you're dead.
That's true.
Yeah, I just don't want to cook off an attempt at that.
That's what I'm saying.
I think there is on that particular point,
I think that this violates the definition.
I think it violates the definition,
violates the condition of the dependency
of the individual.
It would, but then you can see it just
right.
So what I'm going to do is there is a nice
of a proof that if all of a sudden
units meet the mark of boundary condition
of the third law,
but any ensemble of them are on the opposite.
I want to say that there must be a difference.
There must be a difference.
There's a difference, of course.
The point I wanted to make,
because I thought that I thought
about at the moment, is one way of thinking
is that the flux of decision-making
changes the effective mark of boundary
organization of the realm.
So from tasks to tasks,
you've got actually a different set
of mark of boundaries.
I think once you've got that amount
of places to stop into a system,
you're going to be blessing
by the thing that the mark of boundary
is just kind of where the mind stops
and the world begins.
Okay, thank you.
I'm wondering if you're delivering
the victory that the extended mind
defenders want and need.
So there are two reasons for this.
The first one is that,
as you say, conditional
dependencies are everywhere,
and you can easily draw a mark of
boundary around you and your iPhone,
and we'd also draw a third thing
or out or whatever way.
So you get extended mind,
but in a way that's kind of really trigger,
and maybe that's not what it wanted.
So imagine an alternative
history of cognitive philosophy
or whatever, where we all
were extended cognitive services,
and people come around, you come around
and say, well, we can draw the boundary elsewhere.
So that's the first reason.
The other one goes back to
Charlie's definition that you started with.
I couldn't say to a step, it's an extended
condition or an extended mind.
We have to have something outside
of the agent, outside of the mind,
that is part of this mental state.
But the moment you draw the mark
of the blanket, such that
it includes the iPhone, then
that's part of the agent.
The agent is defined by the
mark of the blanket.
So now you actually get a self undermining
argument. You can't be
an extended mind defender
if you start drawing mark of the blankets
around the things you want to extend
the mind to.
You draw a mark of the blanket
to include the iPhone.
Not to exclude the iPhone.
Then it's not external.
Then it's part of the agent.
That's enough. I think that's
actually fine.
Just to speak to that a little bit,
so that just goes against the view
that you start as a single agent
and then you kind of hook up to
something that then extends.
You can start from somewhere else
and think that the system is extended
to the first place.
So the basic set up there is
that cognition is extended
and then it's only special cases
that it's not. Like when I dream about
for instance this kind of thing
at night.
So that would be one way of answering that.
So the first one was
trivializing the claim.
So the notion of
mark of the blanket is so general
that it's going to talk
about external in terms of
means nothing much.
That's sort of the same worry that
you can describe
quite a fair number
of not all systems
that's free energy
minimizing systems and worry about
the explanatory point.
But even if
it's a trivial set up
sorry I'm just thinking my way through this
I don't have the ready to hand that.
Even if it's a trivial set up that I
when incorporated
in the right sort of way with my iPhone
comprising cognitive system
that follows very forward
given its formalism can still say
that there's something external to that blanket.
Yeah.
Presumably.
So it's not the case that it just
kind of balloons out of the portion.
That's in the kind of cognitive
global objection I'm taking which would be trivial
because then you would find cognitive processes
everywhere you look.
So even if it's
fairly simple to draw a boundary
around me and say the microphone
or the iPhone there would still be something
external to that particular boundary.
I take it.
Otherwise it wouldn't be a microphone
actually in the first place.
And that doesn't sound trivial to me.
All it does for me is just in Europe
you still have to do explanatory work
I take it.
Okay I think we're going to come back to that.
We've got time for two more short questions.
No? Back here.
Chris and Ian can you run up
on my phone?
I can try. Thank you very much.
I just wanted to ask you
but I've been wanting to for a long time
how does it connect to the
third wave extended cognition
and just send them
so they are deterioralized
is it cognitive science?
Deteriorized.
That's right.
Probe-gaining internal and external media.
Well
I take it just
for me very simply
it connects in the sort of following way
that
the mark of blanket comes with a set of properties
but
where you draw the blankets can be
negotiated.
In other words there isn't a clear
and only one boundary.
If you can think of the boundary of the
mentors being quite flexible
then that boundary
is up for renegotiation
given if you like constraints
of
ecological constraints
social cultural constraints
biological constraints
that's just how
I draw the inspiration there
from that particular quote
I don't mean to make a big meal of that.
Next question is
on this slide.
Do you have a question sir?
Yes?
You have a question? Yes.
