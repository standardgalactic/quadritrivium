Sorry.
I have a broad exploratory question
so I'll try to do it quickly.
So I've wondered
for a long time I've liked the
predictive processing approach
and I wondered how it dealt
with communities of cognitive
agents of human beings for example
in the sense that
it's
it's based as a word as the individual
organism and it gives a very
interesting account of that
but I was wondering if the mark of blanket
of matter
I wonder if that
suggests the possibility
of thinking
of
various
short-lived communities
of cognitive agents
like people doing something together
and longer
and larger ones.
And because
there are very interesting concepts and problems
relating to that from earlier
discussions for example
problem of common knowledge
and how to model that and so on
and problems
about shared intentions
in communities of robots and so on.
So there are many different areas in which
these problems of groups
have been looked at
and various technical issues that arise.
I'm wondering if your approach
has the possibility
of being used in a way so that
each of the individuals
has
a mark of blanket account
but also the kind of
system whether it be smaller, large,
short-lived or long-lived?
Yeah, I don't think
the notion itself
has much to do with
the kind of the temporal span
over which
you can pick up
that particular separation
between states.
The notion, not on my approach
but just straightforward here,
can be used to segregate
sub-cultures from
mainstream or individuals
in society from larger groups
of individuals.
And I mean there's nothing
it's not
uniquely special
to biologists.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Very quick.
We'll just take a quick five-minute break
and
