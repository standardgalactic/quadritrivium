How could I possibly pass all the time?
So you might have an intuition here that if you don't perceive reality and you don't
even perceive your senses in the way that you think that you do, the degrees of freedom
for having something like free will, they rapidly evaporate, right?
So if you don't have the freedom to move even your prediction errors about the world,
if you don't have the freedom to change your mental model of the world until you get prediction
errors from the environment, the option for choosing what you see and what you do and
what you choose and what you intend and what you feel, those choices don't seem to actually
appear anywhere in the long causal chain of your life.
But you not having free will or perceiving reality, we don't have to get into that right
now.
Next time.
