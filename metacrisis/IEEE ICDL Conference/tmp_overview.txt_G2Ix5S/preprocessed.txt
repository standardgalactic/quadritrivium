1. **Perceptual Inference Tests**: The robot arm was set to a fixed position, and an initial perturbation was introduced to the internal belief (estimation of joint angles). The goal was to have the internal belief converge to the true joint angle positions by minimizing the discrepancy between the camera image and the predicted sensation (visual prediction error). This was achieved through free energy optimization. The tests demonstrated that the robot could successfully minimize the initial error introduced by the perturbation, both in simulation and with a real robot, although the real-world results were less accurate due to noise and environmental differences.

2. **Image-based Goal-driven Control Tests**: The robot aimed to move its arm to imagined (goal) positions in the visual space. Initially, the internal belief was set to the current arm position with a perturbation. Through iterative free energy optimization, the robot generated actions that progressively moved the arm towards the goal. The internal belief updated towards the visual attractor, and an action was taken to minimize the discrepancy between the internal belief and the actual arm position. This process continued until the arm reached the goal. Local minima were a challenge, particularly in more complex scenarios.

3. **Real Robot Results**: When applied to the real robot, both the perceptual inference and image-based goal-driven control tests showed that the robot could perform these tasks but with less accuracy due to mechanical backlash in the actuators and sensor noise.

4. **Future Work**: The researchers aim to scale up active inference for industrial tasks, explore multimodal systems, use more abstract representations of the body to handle complex real-world scenarios, and continue to refine their approach to improve performance, especially with a real robot.

In summary, the presentation outlined successful applications of active inference in both simulation and real-world scenarios for a robotic arm, demonstrating the feasibility of dynamical body estimation and goal-driven control through visual prediction error minimization and free energy optimization. The researchers are working on improving these methods for more complex tasks and environments.
