can actually outperform
or actually match
the performance of
some people are ready to get it
to get them within about 5
or 6 minutes and that basically
calls upon the fact that
the basic scheme
that one would employ
without infrastructure learning
doesn't have high beliefs about the model
that's basically known
that there is a building place
and there is a discussion
about the needs to know
that there is a building place
and we then try to function
some pretentious quote
but this is what I did last night
I know that this is going to be useful
in my world all the terms
that the University have very precise
definitions
and meanings
now that may or may not be useful
depending upon you being mathematically literate
to enjoy or use these terms
in this context
I think the more useful observation
is that there are lots of names
that are exactly the same thing
and in terms of being able to communicate
to other disciplines, other fields
it's probably more useful
having this sort of
definition
in terms of
understanding what you mean
in relation to what somebody else means
so I just read about that before
I do want to thank
the people for these ideas
that I've been talking about
and thank you for your attention
thank you very much indeed
so I really like the idea
that free energy
integrates extended information
and connectivity
I have a question about
how you put together
two types of useful things
particularly regarding the
extended value of information
this usually depends
on the goal that you have at hand
for example if you are looking for yellow bananas
information about yellow objects
it's more important than about blue objects
so it seems to me that for now
the systemic component
of your free energy formula
doesn't take account
the current value of information
but instead
the general value of
getting a better model of the world
whatever your goal is
now I've got very few observations
so as we've started here
when I've simulated here
that's absolutely right
but the systemic
doesn't
know about the prior practices
or the goals
so it's not resolving uncertainty
to enable me to do this
particular thing that I expect to be doing
it's just resolving uncertainty
to enable me to do anything
and I have to believe in that
to do these sorts of things
there are more sophisticated speeds where
you can start to iterate the beliefs in the sound
but in the simple example
I think that's an interesting question
as to whether it is necessary
because you do get the free example
of the formula we were talking about
yesterday which is the
how sometimes
the reward into the terrarium aspects
can at war
eliminate the epistemic aspects
so you get the free ear
by the precision
of the prior preferences
so the
parameterisation preferences
if they're very, very precise
they would come to dominate
the expected free energy
and would induce
the Indian behaviour
that we were talking about yesterday
but as you say
the epistemics are not a function
of, this is not an interaction
about the sort of
simple and relative scale
I should say that
the policies that
you examine in this basic model
of averaging
of course into a simple model
of the prior
and in a sense
which is more close to your question
then
you will
a prior or just consider
a smaller policy that all
facilitated or into the sort of community
so I'm assuming that there is a sort of
constraint that speaks to
the preferred outcomes
in the sense that there are a universe of policies
that would result
in very surprising
that you just need to consider
one more question
it's not a question, it's a comment
do you know our participation in this
in terms of very awesome debate
in the question mark
one more question
thank you very much Carl
I very much appreciate the overall
as you just said
in this theory everything is very precise
and
one of the things which is very precise
is the quantity that
the system is trying to minimise
and as I understood it is
the kind of lower bound of the voyager surprise
what is according to you
the comparative utility
of this particular measure
compared to other forms of
measures I think instead of the lower bound
why not the higher bound
that I've read
why not the non-validations measure of surprise
why not using conditional errors
of your own networks
who are not able to do probabilities
so what is your view on this
my view is the thing you actually
want to minimise
is the surprise of yourself
and your nature
and literally your
garnering of evidence for your existence
so you are a model
you model that world
and you sample it in a way to
maximise the evidence of your existence
maximise the margin of likelihood
of your construction of the world
that looks as if you are minimising
the surprise of your body
surprising what you've heard
uncertain scenarios
so that's what we would like to do
from the point of view of a
that's a bit easier
to realise that we've basically
been fully based on the law
that's impossible
so you have to approach with basic evidence
you can always look at some of the problems
of the variation
that low bound
on the evidence
everything that you've mentioned
I don't speak
very lemonly now
but I think I can defend it
in any scheme
that is optimal
and in any sense
we'll come forth to this for this
so precision weight of prediction
that is one nice example
you were captured yesterday
and said what happened to confidence
of course you know it's precision weight of prediction
so the free energy
