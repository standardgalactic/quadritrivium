to now start to fill in the gap
in terms of digital electrical physiology
in terms of
elevator potentials
in terms of
changes in this precision parameter here
with very much a lot of
the sorts of responses
in this issue.
Giving very
biologically plausible
dynamics for
status commotion of influence
across the selection and digital learning
in that sort here
that want to then use
the digital technology
to understand some
empirical data
all the sample
and a lot of sample data
that's related to evidence of humiliation
inherent in this epistemic part
of the diversions between chosen
and unchosen options
with the architecture
of inferring and sequential policies
that we use
about the past and the future
and how that leads into
transition
and the sorts of dynamics that are needed
in the calculus of being able to get out of this
simulation
that we show with
practical activity,
process simulation, smack negativity
and transfer of digital responses
and so I want to complete now
with an example
I'm not sure we have time to go through it
but I want to adjust to
because this is a fun one really
I want to play a game
I don't have time to go through it
so we'll just play a game anyway
is how you learn
how you
expose yourself
to situations
that enable you to make sense
of the world
and the particular game
that I'm going to make those equations
try to solve
and play is this game here
and the game is a sport
there is a correct part
and you
have to tell me
what the correct colour is
by indicating
your choice on what these things are
whether green or blue
and I'll tell you that there is
a rule
there are three rules
that determine what the colour is
and your job
by trying to work out
what the rules are
what is the correct colour
in a particular pattern
of stimuli on the game
and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to try and find out
how quickly you can get to the rule
and then I can see how quickly
that basic speed can define the rule
so let's just swap
who wants to have a game
you will get to the right colour
what colour do you think is the
correct colour is
for example blue
blue
or green
do I have another go?
what do I have next?
who?
for the part which I want
first one
now for the second
sentence
red
no I'm afraid it's green
I'm sorry
what about you
another blue
what does anyone want to do?
no I'm very sorry
it was red
what about this one
anybody?
what blue
no it was green
think about it
what about this one
anybody red
oh no
I'm sorry it was green
right anybody here
green
wow
now when you think you've got it
put your hand up
when you think you've got it
the person who gets it will be here
do you get it this one?
blue
no I'm sorry
this one green
no I'm sorry it was red
this one green
yes
that was good
but first it gets green
what would you think of this one?
green
no
and this one
green
green
yes
oh you think you've got it?
no so many
ok 30 seconds
ok
anybody
what is your guess on this one?
green
anybody?
red
green
this one
green
blue
this one
no
well what you just said
you didn't get it
I'll tell you
the rule was
if it's green
then
if it's green
then it's always green
if it's blue
it's the colour
on the right
and if it's
um
um
um
so
tell that on the centre
I'm sorry
the colour in the centre
basically tells you
whether the right colour is on the right
or the left
now Lawrence you've seen this before
you should have been guessing
you forgot it
anyway that's it
if you're on your hands
and people get it by half
so it's 6
and 12
what I wonder
that I have time
is to see
souls as well
and sorted it about 12
using
what I think is
put the best way
from the perspective of this scheme
to describe how it feels to be
which is to resolve
uncertainty not backing the space
in the world
but uncertainty about the parameters
and the light
that correspond
to the structure
and then we want
to consider
structure learning and why
this scheme
