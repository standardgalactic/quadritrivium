I'm going to use that as a premise of that. I'm going to use that simple observation. The first thing you do when you need or choosing to choose your next move is to resolve uncertainty, identify the location of the creating this instance.

ipping the epistemments into a data part of ourket.
We're both in a game of trying to understand the interplay between the pragmatic and epistemic components,
the heritance of the good ways to behave, so like to I'm part whom not.
So we're part who not here likely in terms of the distinction between selecting an action policy
that maximises some value function of the net state in interplay,
ac ac felly rwy'n deall eich ac arenaeriaeth agwedd

I'm in my world, but I believe I'll be a probability distribution.
Therefore we know that the thing that needs to be optimised is not a function of states,
but a function of units as I've said, and they're devoted by QBF, given some action.
So that's the first thing that the mistake example tells us,
that we want to find a big gap, a new one, that optimises the function of beliefs.

I associate this energy function on the air of fire, essentially that function of the energy,
and the sum of energy at a time is in action.
So all I'm doing is really regenerating how it is a principle of least action.
So the dynamic that I'm introducing isn't that I'm going to go with what there is on the air of fire,
and try to optimise the value function and the policies that it puts up on the air of fire function,
or the different kinds of principles of least action.
These have a lot of different flavours in them.
So if that was on the air of fire, it's going to be a lot of control theory,
a very, very important learning, and so on.
Whereas if we go with the principles of least action,
we're going to go about the difference in learning of the philosophy which is in meditation,
and so on and so forth.
Partially observed and we respect a lot of decision processes.
So that's the deliberate divide I'm introducing, and now we're trying to put them back together.
And the way that we're going to do that is by appealing to one principle,
the principle that everything that we do, everything that we believe,
is in the service of minimising surprises or surprise,
or more particularly, a lower barrier of surprise,
which we're going to refer to as a direction of free energy.
Furthermore, I'm going to assume that it is the case that to behave optimally,
I have to believe that my behaviours will minimise the expected free energy as a result of my behaviour.
So, what does that mean?
If I can write down my beliefs about behavior in terms of an expected free energy approach,
I'm going to try to...
So, the primal ability of a policy part comprises the significance of action,
so we now have an actual of this free energy,
where this free energy has the law in terms of it,
it has an energy term, it has an energy term.
Don't worry about the maths, I don't have the maths formula,
we'll hopefully get it to a place that I'm using words and concepts that are very familiar.
I'll just mark out this energy term here,
which is a life model, a prior idea.
I've rearranged it, I've rearranged it in a way that starts with a sense of this distinction
between the explicit value of the agency,
and the sense of this information here.
So, let me try and look at that equation,
and eliminate certain parts of it to see how we can interpret it.
Now, the first thing we're going to eliminate are these prior differences,
these prior, not prior differences about outcomes,
given a particular charity involved in the world.
I eliminate that, and I'm going to do this expected basis part,
or care, like what you can say,
that basically scores the difference in my beliefs about the world
before and after observing outcomes that are consequent to my belief.
That quantity is mathematical,
and the basic surprise that we're going to live from any new working in visual savings and surges
is the quantity that creates a savings map in terms of where to connect.
Interestingly, this expression, this expected care divergence,
is also the mutual information between the causes of outcomes and the outcomes itself.
So, it's also an expression of the principle of maximum mutual information,
minimum redundancy principle, principle of maximum efficiency,
as articulated by people like Boris Barlow.
One thing we know is what these applied preferences back into the game,
and consider another special case.
Another special case is when we can remove any uncertainty
about the states that I'm observing.
So, I don't take ambiguity out of the equation
so that I can directly observe states.
In other words, the s is becoming those,
so the states of observations become identical,
and I now will focus on the second case, the stomach part here,
and this map becomes a simple divergence between
the outcomes that are predicted,
and the outcomes of any ideal that I prefer.
That's known in engineering as KL,
and that's cutting control,
and economics is a specific sensitive control.
Of course, if you are a physiologist,
then you would see the social family things like those states as well.
So, the next simplification is putting the private,
even the private as a simple case,
but now eliminating this ambiguity.
So, I'm taking up all uncertainty off the table,
because what we're going to do is simply be expected
of the result of our third outcomes.
By searching, I want to be able to keep with value
a very simple and expected value.
So, all of these things only will be there, too.
I've also mentioned one option that I can do here.
I can remove all the preferences,
I can remove all the ambiguity about the states,
all the causes of outcomes,
and see what's left and what's left is just the uncertainty
of my ideas about the future,
which means that if I have no preferences
and there's no epistemic value
meant to be obtained from the world,
then the best thing to do
will be to simply keep my options open,
and that's sometimes described in terms of genes,
and that's what I'm thinking of this for.
So, if it is a case that we can articulate good behaviour
and understand all its special cases
in terms of this one notion of choosing behaviours
that minimise inspected free energy,
it will be therefore necessary to specify the derivative models
under which I go to evaluate my free energy.
So, I'm going to just introduce a very simple model
for the purpose of a model more than imaginable
in the model of a model or a model of a decision process,
just to put some flesh into the optimisation scheme
and use that to simulate an active agent.
So, this is a very simple model where we're going to escape to the world
and then we're going to look at involved
kinds of positive transition matrices
that we've used by idea here,
and these states, everyone,
are going to come here,
so that's a matter between the states
and the outcomes that are likely to be achieved here,
and these transition matrices
depend upon the actions or forces that are adopted,
and these are the sorts of random variables
that I have to refer.
These differences are more or less confident
and I'm introducing here a terminal
that's a territorial decision factor here
that scales the certainty of confidence that I have
about the policies that I've set up
and what I'm actually doing in terms of my transitions,
in terms of the transition between states,
from the first state to the next state,
and the subsequent outcomes.
So, that's the model.
It's as simple a model as you can imagine.
So, if I now take that model
and insert it into the equations
that I described on the previous slide,
and now in a position to estimate
or to write down update rules,
basically update rules,
that will optimise my beliefs
about the unknowns in relation to this band
when it's added surprise,
namely the variation of free-editing.
If I do that,
some very, very simple equations emerge.
First of all,
there are three things that we don't have.
We don't know the states of the world,
we don't know the policy,
and we don't know the inverse temperature
or the precision of our beliefs about the policy.
So, infants in this context
or active infants in this context
simply means updating the expectations
about these unknown quantities.
So, we can associate perception
with an update of this form,
which actually has a very, very, very,
interesting performance,
this sort of softmax function
of living experience of expectations
about the previous and subsequent states
and a life term conveyed
by the opposite of outcomes.
Action selection reduces
to a classical softmax function
of the goodness,
the limited goodness of policy,
the expected free energy,
the precision,
and the savings
of the temperature itself,
or the gamma,
now takes the form of,
and it's put into the prediction error
about the expected value
of the active free energy here.
So, it's a very similar to the rules of prediction error.
I can just iterate these equations
that will provide me with the solutions
and minimise the free energy
of massimise or minimise my expected surprise
and follow that.
I can derive a particular belief about what I'm doing,
select the best action
and then generate a new outcome
and the cycle we're going to get.
I'm just taking through the architecture
that falls out of this sort of speed.
I think it's interesting to know
that the cycle of updating
is a consequence of the genetic model.
So, I'm not writing anything into the speed
more than is offered by the very simple form
of the genetic model to which I'm applying
this minimisation speed to.
So, what the anatomy is,
the anatomy that is suggested by this,
is very similar to the form of the sensory equation,
which is stating the estimation
under all the rules of the policies.
From this, we can estimate
the expected free energy
of each of these policies.
That, indeed, will result in the process of selection,
and last optimising our precision
of confidence in that selection
of our temperature from the yesterday general.
Jill is talking about flattening representations.
This flattening corresponds to that
softmax parameter I'm going to assume.
Having identified the best or the probability
to use the policies,
they will give you basically what that means
in that state.
If they know how to act and realise that state,
we can make that act and solicit
a new algorithm on the model
and then the cycle begins again.
All we're doing is minimising
various sorts of surprises
or expected surprises.
So, just don't illustrate how that scheme works.
I'm going to give you a simple example.
This is a two-step maze task
where we can argue about
whether there's a constitutive cure
or some other algorithm.
It doesn't, but we can talk about that later.
The task is to locate a reward
at one of the two arms in the teammates here,
but the agent starts at the centre
and can't see where the reward is.
However, it does know that there's an instructional cue
at the bottom part here.
So, when it's blue, the reward is on this side
and when it's blue, it's on that side.
When it goes to one of the eight of the arms,
it has to stay at the absolute source of the state.
This is a very simple task.
We can do two moves.
Now, if it's great for the reward,
it doesn't know where the reward is,
or it can go into the instructional cue.
I don't know what the different speakers say.
There's also a certainty about where the reward is,
and secondly, it can then go and secure the reward.
We can wind the flyer problem down
in terms of the parameters of that generative model
that I just described.
Very simple in terms of A, B and C.
The A matrix is a mapping of different states of the world,
in two flames, where I am,
and the context in which I operated
is the reward on the left and on the right.
For each of the remaining states,
though we'll be able to do the outcome,
I'm having to like outcomes where I have a location
where the reward is.
In this context, or here,
I didn't really manage to see that in this cost.
The softness of it changes with the prior preferences.
So, each of the boundary,
and the time, reward,
I've just kept myself to be in a location
with a reward that would be lot,
and conversely,
or a video location,
has not been rewarded.
The B matrix,
I can't change the context,
I can't change my notation,
so all the B matrix is doing is saying,
I can move to more than four places,
because there are two moves that are going to be
10 movements, because there are two moves
that are absorbing them into arms,
and the other two moves allow for
moving to more than four locations.
So, that's the set up.
This is the sort of behaviour that emerges from the set up.
I've shown the behaviour here
in terms of behaviour in the top two levels,
and I've simulated a lot of responses
in the bottom two levels.
I have to motivate them where they came from.
So, this is focusing on this.
So, what I'm doing here
is presenting the reward of this side,
and this side, and this side,
and repeating the reward presentation
on the same side,
until the age of it starts to learn
that the reward is all done on the same side.
And the key length of the logic
in terms of the moves about the initial state,
that's a deep parameter here,
such that as time goes on,
it gets more and more confident.
Thank you.
It gets more and more confident
about its behaviour.
So, initially,
and these are the kind of policies,
initially it will go down
at the stability of the porridge,
find out against the reward on that side,
and then on the second move it will go to the reward.
And yet, later on,
when its behaviour is much more confident,
because it all thinks enormously
at that context,
it will go directly to the reward side
and become insportative.
So, this is the straights
of what is great emphasis of this sort of speed.
First of all,
go and in there,
harvest all the epistemic value
available to you
until you resolve uncertainty.
There's no further information available.
And at that point,
the client references the pragmatic aspects
of your behaviour kicking
and your behaviour gracefully
or transitions from being insportive
to insportative.
And the reason that words
or you get that sort of behaviour
for three is that when you put the utility
or the pragmatics
on the same consent currency
as the epistemic,
as the information chain.
So, there is literally a valuable information
in exactly the same sense
that any utility can mix with sort of gifts
or gnats.
By virtue of that,
when there's a natural balance,
I think it usually ends up
with, first of all,
a limited uncertainty,
and then they turn to fragments.
I'm going to a real human's lesson.
What I would normally do up here
is revisit
that sort of behaviour
by literally hersoing
the laser updates
and noting that we can convert
this into a process theory
by sort of just solving
the poor information objective function here
in the respect of the energy
use a gradient of cent.
What does that
want
to now start to fill in the gap
in terms of digital electrical physiology
in terms of
elevator potentials
in terms of
changes in this precision parameter here
with very much a lot of
the sorts of responses
in this issue.
Giving very
biologically plausible
dynamics for
status commotion of influence
across the selection and digital learning
in that sort here
that want to then use
the digital technology
to understand some
empirical data
all the sample
and a lot of sample data
that's related to evidence of humiliation
inherent in this epistemic part
of the diversions between chosen
and unchosen options
with the architecture
of inferring and sequential policies
that we use
about the past and the future
and how that leads into
transition
and the sorts of dynamics that are needed
in the calculus of being able to get out of this
simulation
that we show with
practical activity,
process simulation, smack negativity
and transfer of digital responses
and so I want to complete now
with an example
I'm not sure we have time to go through it
but I want to adjust to
because this is a fun one really
I want to play a game
I don't have time to go through it
so we'll just play a game anyway
is how you learn
how you
expose yourself
to situations
that enable you to make sense
of the world
and the particular game
that I'm going to make those equations
try to solve
and play is this game here
and the game is a sport
there is a correct part
and you
have to tell me
what the correct colour is
by indicating
your choice on what these things are
whether green or blue
and I'll tell you that there is
a rule
there are three rules
that determine what the colour is
and your job
by trying to work out
what the rules are
what is the correct colour
in a particular pattern
of stimuli on the game
and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to try and find out
how quickly you can get to the rule
and then I can see how quickly
that basic speed can define the rule
so let's just swap
who wants to have a game
you will get to the right colour
what colour do you think is the
correct colour is
for example blue
blue
or green
do I have another go?
what do I have next?
who?
for the part which I want
first one
now for the second
sentence
red
no I'm afraid it's green
I'm sorry
what about you
another blue
what does anyone want to do?
no I'm very sorry
it was red
what about this one
anybody?
what blue
no it was green
think about it
what about this one
anybody red
oh no
I'm sorry it was green
right anybody here
green
wow
now when you think you've got it
put your hand up
when you think you've got it
the person who gets it will be here
do you get it this one?
blue
no I'm sorry
this one green
no I'm sorry it was red
this one green
yes
that was good
but first it gets green
what would you think of this one?
green
no
and this one
green
green
yes
oh you think you've got it?
no so many
ok 30 seconds
ok
anybody
what is your guess on this one?
green
anybody?
red
green
this one
green
blue
this one
no
well what you just said
you didn't get it
I'll tell you
the rule was
if it's green
then
if it's green
then it's always green
if it's blue
it's the colour
on the right
and if it's
um
um
um
so
tell that on the centre
I'm sorry
the colour in the centre
basically tells you
whether the right colour is on the right
or the left
now Lawrence you've seen this before
you should have been guessing
you forgot it
anyway that's it
if you're on your hands
and people get it by half
so it's 6
and 12
what I wonder
that I have time
is to see
souls as well
and sorted it about 12
using
what I think is
put the best way
from the perspective of this scheme
to describe how it feels to be
which is to resolve
uncertainty not backing the space
in the world
but uncertainty about the parameters
and the light
that correspond
to the structure
and then we want
to consider
structure learning and why
this scheme
can actually outperform
or actually match
the performance of
some people are ready to get it
to get them within about 5
or 6 minutes and that basically
calls upon the fact that
the basic scheme
that one would employ
without infrastructure learning
doesn't have high beliefs about the model
that's basically known
that there is a building place
and there is a discussion
about the needs to know
that there is a building place
and we then try to function
some pretentious quote
but this is what I did last night
I know that this is going to be useful
in my world all the terms
that the University have very precise
definitions
and meanings
now that may or may not be useful
depending upon you being mathematically literate
to enjoy or use these terms
in this context
I think the more useful observation
is that there are lots of names
that are exactly the same thing
and in terms of being able to communicate
to other disciplines, other fields
it's probably more useful
having this sort of
definition
in terms of
understanding what you mean
in relation to what somebody else means
so I just read about that before
I do want to thank
the people for these ideas
that I've been talking about
and thank you for your attention
thank you very much indeed
so I really like the idea
that free energy
integrates extended information
and connectivity
I have a question about
how you put together
two types of useful things
particularly regarding the
extended value of information
this usually depends
on the goal that you have at hand
for example if you are looking for yellow bananas
information about yellow objects
it's more important than about blue objects
so it seems to me that for now
the systemic component
of your free energy formula
doesn't take account
the current value of information
but instead
the general value of
getting a better model of the world
whatever your goal is
now I've got very few observations
so as we've started here
when I've simulated here
that's absolutely right
but the systemic
doesn't
know about the prior practices
or the goals
so it's not resolving uncertainty
to enable me to do this
particular thing that I expect to be doing
it's just resolving uncertainty
to enable me to do anything
and I have to believe in that
to do these sorts of things
there are more sophisticated speeds where
you can start to iterate the beliefs in the sound
but in the simple example
I think that's an interesting question
as to whether it is necessary
because you do get the free example
of the formula we were talking about
yesterday which is the
how sometimes
the reward into the terrarium aspects
can at war
eliminate the epistemic aspects
so you get the free ear
by the precision
of the prior preferences
so the
parameterisation preferences
if they're very, very precise
they would come to dominate
the expected free energy
and would induce
the Indian behaviour
that we were talking about yesterday
but as you say
the epistemics are not a function
of, this is not an interaction
about the sort of
simple and relative scale
I should say that
the policies that
you examine in this basic model
of averaging
of course into a simple model
of the prior
and in a sense
which is more close to your question
then
you will
a prior or just consider
a smaller policy that all
facilitated or into the sort of community
so I'm assuming that there is a sort of
constraint that speaks to
the preferred outcomes
in the sense that there are a universe of policies
that would result
in very surprising
that you just need to consider
one more question
it's not a question, it's a comment
do you know our participation in this
in terms of very awesome debate
in the question mark
one more question
thank you very much Carl
I very much appreciate the overall
as you just said
in this theory everything is very precise
and
one of the things which is very precise
is the quantity that
the system is trying to minimise
and as I understood it is
the kind of lower bound of the voyager surprise
what is according to you
the comparative utility
of this particular measure
compared to other forms of
measures I think instead of the lower bound
why not the higher bound
that I've read
why not the non-validations measure of surprise
why not using conditional errors
of your own networks
who are not able to do probabilities
so what is your view on this
my view is the thing you actually
want to minimise
is the surprise of yourself
and your nature
and literally your
garnering of evidence for your existence
so you are a model
you model that world
and you sample it in a way to
maximise the evidence of your existence
maximise the margin of likelihood
of your construction of the world
that looks as if you are minimising
the surprise of your body
surprising what you've heard
uncertain scenarios
so that's what we would like to do
from the point of view of a
that's a bit easier
to realise that we've basically
been fully based on the law
that's impossible
so you have to approach with basic evidence
you can always look at some of the problems
of the variation
that low bound
on the evidence
everything that you've mentioned
I don't speak
very lemonly now
but I think I can defend it
in any scheme
that is optimal
and in any sense
we'll come forth to this for this
so precision weight of prediction
that is one nice example
you were captured yesterday
and said what happened to confidence
of course you know it's precision weight of prediction
so the free energy
which is an elbow of the evidence
low bound
is a mixture
of precision weight of prediction
that gives an entire attitude
to use confidence
of prediction evidence
as a proxy for surprise
that is exactly the size
of the variation area
is that okay?
okay, alright thank you very much
our next speaker
is Jean-Lucas
