I'm going to use that as a premise of that. I'm going to use that simple observation. The first thing you do when you need or choosing to choose your next move is to resolve uncertainty, identify the location of the creating this instance.

ipping the epistemments into a data part of ourket.
We're both in a game of trying to understand the interplay between the pragmatic and epistemic components,
the heritance of the good ways to behave, so like to I'm part whom not.
So we're part who not here likely in terms of the distinction between selecting an action policy
that maximises some value function of the net state in interplay,
ac ac felly rwy'n deall eich ac arenaeriaeth agwedd
agwyl iawn.
Felly dnowid iddo
yn y flynyddiant y pais.
I'm in my world, but I believe I'll be a probability distribution.
Therefore we know that the thing that needs to be optimised is not a function of states,
but a function of units as I've said, and they're devoted by QBF, given some action.
So that's the first thing that the mistake example tells us,
that we want to find a big gap, a new one, that optimises the function of beliefs.

I associate this energy function on the air of fire, essentially that function of the energy,
and the sum of energy at a time is in action.
So all I'm doing is really regenerating how it is a principle of least action.
So the dynamic that I'm introducing isn't that I'm going to go with what there is on the air of fire,
and try to optimise the value function and the policies that it puts up on the air of fire function,
or the different kinds of principles of least action.
These have a lot of different flavours in them.
So if that was on the air of fire, it's going to be a lot of control theory,
a very, very important learning, and so on.
Whereas if we go with the principles of least action,
we're going to go about the difference in learning of the philosophy which is in meditation,
and so on and so forth.
Partially observed and we respect a lot of decision processes.
So that's the deliberate divide I'm introducing, and now we're trying to put them back together.
And the way that we're going to do that is by appealing to one principle,
the principle that everything that we do, everything that we believe,
is in the service of minimising surprises or surprise,
or more particularly, a lower barrier of surprise,
which we're going to refer to as a direction of free energy.
Furthermore, I'm going to assume that it is the case that to behave optimally,
I have to believe that my behaviours will minimise the expected free energy as a result of my behaviour.
So, what does that mean?
If I can write down my beliefs about behavior in terms of an expected free energy approach,
I'm going to try to...
So, the primal ability of a policy part comprises the significance of action,
so we now have an actual of this free energy,
where this free energy has the law in terms of it,
it has an energy term, it has an energy term.
Don't worry about the maths, I don't have the maths formula,
we'll hopefully get it to a place that I'm using words and concepts that are very familiar.
I'll just mark out this energy term here,
which is a life model, a prior idea.
I've rearranged it, I've rearranged it in a way that starts with a sense of this distinction
between the explicit value of the agency,
and the sense of this information here.
So, let me try and look at that equation,
and eliminate certain parts of it to see how we can interpret it.
Now, the first thing we're going to eliminate are these prior differences,
these prior, not prior differences about outcomes,
given a particular charity involved in the world.
I eliminate that, and I'm going to do this expected basis part,
or care, like what you can say,
that basically scores the difference in my beliefs about the world
before and after observing outcomes that are consequent to my belief.
That quantity is mathematical,
and the basic surprise that we're going to live from any new working in visual savings and surges
is the quantity that creates a savings map in terms of where to connect.
Interestingly, this expression, this expected care divergence,
is also the mutual information between the causes of outcomes and the outcomes itself.
So, it's also an expression of the principle of maximum mutual information,
minimum redundancy principle, principle of maximum efficiency,
as articulated by people like Boris Barlow.
One thing we know is what these applied preferences back into the game,
and consider another special case.
Another special case is when we can remove any uncertainty
about the states that I'm observing.
So, I don't take ambiguity out of the equation
so that I can directly observe states.
In other words, the s is becoming those,
so the states of observations become identical,
and I now will focus on the second case, the stomach part here,
and this map becomes a simple divergence between
the outcomes that are predicted,
and the outcomes of any ideal that I prefer.
That's known in engineering as KL,
and that's cutting control,
and economics is a specific sensitive control.
Of course, if you are a physiologist,
then you would see the social family things like those states as well.
So, the next simplification is putting the private,
even the private as a simple case,
but now eliminating this ambiguity.
So, I'm taking up all uncertainty off the table,
because what we're going to do is simply be expected
of the result of our third outcomes.
By searching, I want to be able to keep with value
a very simple and expected value.
So, all of these things only will be there, too.
I've also mentioned one option that I can do here.
I can remove all the preferences,
I can remove all the ambiguity about the states,
all the causes of outcomes,
and see what's left and what's left is just the uncertainty
of my ideas about the future,
which means that if I have no preferences
and there's no epistemic value
meant to be obtained from the world,
then the best thing to do
will be to simply keep my options open,
and that's sometimes described in terms of genes,
and that's what I'm thinking of this for.
So, if it is a case that we can articulate good behaviour
and understand all its special cases
in terms of this one notion of choosing behaviours
that minimise inspected free energy,
it will be therefore necessary to specify the derivative models
under which I go to evaluate my free energy.
So, I'm going to just introduce a very simple model
for the purpose of a model more than imaginable
in the model of a model or a model of a decision process,
just to put some flesh into the optimisation scheme
and use that to simulate an active agent.
So, this is a very simple model where we're going to escape to the world
and then we're going to look at involved
kinds of positive transition matrices
that we've used by idea here,
and these states, everyone,
are going to come here,
so that's a matter between the states
and the outcomes that are likely to be achieved here,
and these transition matrices
depend upon the actions or forces that are adopted,
and these are the sorts of random variables
that I have to refer.
These differences are more or less confident
and I'm introducing here a terminal
that's a territorial decision factor here
that scales the certainty of confidence that I have
about the policies that I've set up
and what I'm actually doing in terms of my transitions,
in terms of the transition between states,
from the first state to the next state,
and the subsequent outcomes.
So, that's the model.
It's as simple a model as you can imagine.
So, if I now take that model
and insert it into the equations
that I described on the previous slide,
and now in a position to estimate
or to write down update rules,
basically update rules,
that will optimise my beliefs
about the unknowns in relation to this band
when it's added surprise,
namely the variation of free-editing.
If I do that,
some very, very simple equations emerge.
First of all,
there are three things that we don't have.
We don't know the states of the world,
we don't know the policy,
and we don't know the inverse temperature
or the precision of our beliefs about the policy.
So, infants in this context
or active infants in this context
simply means updating the expectations
about these unknown quantities.
So, we can associate perception
with an update of this form,
which actually has a very, very, very,
interesting performance,
