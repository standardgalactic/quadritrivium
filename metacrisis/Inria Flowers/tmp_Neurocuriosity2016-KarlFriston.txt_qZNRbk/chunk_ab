this sort of softmax function
of living experience of expectations
about the previous and subsequent states
and a life term conveyed
by the opposite of outcomes.
Action selection reduces
to a classical softmax function
of the goodness,
the limited goodness of policy,
the expected free energy,
the precision,
and the savings
of the temperature itself,
or the gamma,
now takes the form of,
and it's put into the prediction error
about the expected value
of the active free energy here.
So, it's a very similar to the rules of prediction error.
I can just iterate these equations
that will provide me with the solutions
and minimise the free energy
of massimise or minimise my expected surprise
and follow that.
I can derive a particular belief about what I'm doing,
select the best action
and then generate a new outcome
and the cycle we're going to get.
I'm just taking through the architecture
that falls out of this sort of speed.
I think it's interesting to know
that the cycle of updating
is a consequence of the genetic model.
So, I'm not writing anything into the speed
more than is offered by the very simple form
of the genetic model to which I'm applying
this minimisation speed to.
So, what the anatomy is,
the anatomy that is suggested by this,
is very similar to the form of the sensory equation,
which is stating the estimation
under all the rules of the policies.
From this, we can estimate
the expected free energy
of each of these policies.
That, indeed, will result in the process of selection,
and last optimising our precision
of confidence in that selection
of our temperature from the yesterday general.
Jill is talking about flattening representations.
This flattening corresponds to that
softmax parameter I'm going to assume.
Having identified the best or the probability
to use the policies,
they will give you basically what that means
in that state.
If they know how to act and realise that state,
we can make that act and solicit
a new algorithm on the model
and then the cycle begins again.
All we're doing is minimising
various sorts of surprises
or expected surprises.
So, just don't illustrate how that scheme works.
I'm going to give you a simple example.
This is a two-step maze task
where we can argue about
whether there's a constitutive cure
or some other algorithm.
It doesn't, but we can talk about that later.
The task is to locate a reward
at one of the two arms in the teammates here,
but the agent starts at the centre
and can't see where the reward is.
However, it does know that there's an instructional cue
at the bottom part here.
So, when it's blue, the reward is on this side
and when it's blue, it's on that side.
When it goes to one of the eight of the arms,
it has to stay at the absolute source of the state.
This is a very simple task.
We can do two moves.
Now, if it's great for the reward,
it doesn't know where the reward is,
or it can go into the instructional cue.
I don't know what the different speakers say.
There's also a certainty about where the reward is,
and secondly, it can then go and secure the reward.
We can wind the flyer problem down
in terms of the parameters of that generative model
that I just described.
Very simple in terms of A, B and C.
The A matrix is a mapping of different states of the world,
in two flames, where I am,
and the context in which I operated
is the reward on the left and on the right.
For each of the remaining states,
though we'll be able to do the outcome,
I'm having to like outcomes where I have a location
where the reward is.
In this context, or here,
I didn't really manage to see that in this cost.
The softness of it changes with the prior preferences.
So, each of the boundary,
and the time, reward,
I've just kept myself to be in a location
with a reward that would be lot,
and conversely,
or a video location,
has not been rewarded.
The B matrix,
I can't change the context,
I can't change my notation,
so all the B matrix is doing is saying,
I can move to more than four places,
because there are two moves that are going to be
10 movements, because there are two moves
that are absorbing them into arms,
and the other two moves allow for
moving to more than four locations.
So, that's the set up.
This is the sort of behaviour that emerges from the set up.
I've shown the behaviour here
in terms of behaviour in the top two levels,
and I've simulated a lot of responses
in the bottom two levels.
I have to motivate them where they came from.
So, this is focusing on this.
So, what I'm doing here
is presenting the reward of this side,
and this side, and this side,
and repeating the reward presentation
on the same side,
until the age of it starts to learn
that the reward is all done on the same side.
And the key length of the logic
in terms of the moves about the initial state,
that's a deep parameter here,
such that as time goes on,
it gets more and more confident.
Thank you.
It gets more and more confident
about its behaviour.
So, initially,
and these are the kind of policies,
initially it will go down
at the stability of the porridge,
find out against the reward on that side,
and then on the second move it will go to the reward.
And yet, later on,
when its behaviour is much more confident,
because it all thinks enormously
at that context,
it will go directly to the reward side
and become insportative.
So, this is the straights
of what is great emphasis of this sort of speed.
First of all,
go and in there,
harvest all the epistemic value
available to you
until you resolve uncertainty.
There's no further information available.
And at that point,
the client references the pragmatic aspects
of your behaviour kicking
and your behaviour gracefully
or transitions from being insportive
to insportative.
And the reason that words
or you get that sort of behaviour
for three is that when you put the utility
or the pragmatics
on the same consent currency
as the epistemic,
as the information chain.
So, there is literally a valuable information
in exactly the same sense
that any utility can mix with sort of gifts
or gnats.
By virtue of that,
when there's a natural balance,
I think it usually ends up
with, first of all,
a limited uncertainty,
and then they turn to fragments.
I'm going to a real human's lesson.
What I would normally do up here
is revisit
that sort of behaviour
by literally hersoing
the laser updates
and noting that we can convert
this into a process theory
by sort of just solving
the poor information objective function here
in the respect of the energy
use a gradient of cent.
What does that
want
