horizons of focus that I pay attention to. I pay attention to like immediate triage
which isn't trying to reform the current systems and it isn't trying to build new
ones it's just trying to keep some terrible shit from happening that we can't fix afterwards.
And so like how do we prevent massive death in India right now and massive escalation of
violence? We're not even we're not going to fix capitalism or fix corruption or fix the current
Indian government to do that. It's like can we can we do the right things with supply chains and aid
and shit to be able to prevent because there are some issues that you can prevent but you can't fix
them after they've happened they they are irreversibly destructive. And so one of the things I'm very
focused on is the kind of sense making that shows us the escalation pathways to various types of
irreversible catastrophic risk so that we can identify the most targeted interventions to
stop those things from happening. So that's actually neither fixing the current systems
nor making better ones right that's just keep the patient from bleeding out.
Then there is how do we work with the current institutions to make them better because
we're not going to have post capitalist post nation state post democratic societies running
the world in the next few years we're just there's no fucking way that's going to happen.
And it's not even going to happen in the generation their generational shift has to occur
for the up leveling of systemic sense making and for good systems that start to happen somewhere
to get through the resistance necessary to be the primary operating system. So that means that the
you know 50 to 100 trillion dollars that trades hands every day that is that much
collective human incentive and human behavior is going to keep running through the systems
that's running through for a while. So we have to take those systems and make them less terrible
I'm not even going to say more good just less terrible. And that's kind of the second horizon
of focus is institutional repair. How do we take and most of the institutions we currently have
were better when they were created and then they decayed because predatory opportunism kind of
decayed them. And that's actually if you you know Samo probably spoke about that when he was on here
Michael Vassar might have the theory of institutional decay civilizational decay.
So if we look at the way that the American Republic wasn't initially intended it would
it's it's not a perfect form of governance and it of course doesn't address how to deal with a
decentralized exponential tech world and and Facebook like it doesn't they weren't thinking
about those issues so we need something better than that. But it's so many thousands of times
better than the shit we have right now that is basically like a maximally corrupt kleptocracy
pretending to be a republic and not even pretending all that much because it doesn't
matter what people think because they don't do anything which was very clear in things like
the Epstein case or even covid right now but Epstein case was very interesting to me because
that marked the hallmark in my witnessing in the US where some people still believed in the news to
where nobody actually believed in the news if they're paying attention because when Epstein died
all of the major publications whether they were believed to be right-leaning or left-leaning if
they're major publications continuously and only said when Epstein commits suicide in prison
and I just don't know anyone that actually thinks that he commits suicide in prison
and so what that meant was everyone said
what the fuck is that if the left and the right-leaning and supposedly owned by different
people and different organizations and they're all saying something that nobody believes and then
but still nobody does shit about it because nobody thinks they can do anything about it and
they're all on benzos and opiates and porn and facebook so they're kind of too weakened and
addicted to do anything anyways plus if you think about trying to go do something about it you're
like okay don't revolutions require violence the SWAT team has tanks like what the fuck do we do
against tanks so how do you deal with these things when it seems like there things are actually
relatively comfortable and no matter how upset I get by the time I've scrolled Facebook for five
minutes I forgot right like the hypernormal stimulus is strong enough that I forgot and the
seeming chance of succeeding at something seems so hard that people just it doesn't really matter
so we don't even have to pretend that there is a republic that much anymore
on the Epstein thing it's important to just kind of say here
people who paid attention there said okay wait so Mueller said
when he was trying him the first time said publicly I was told to shut this case down
that he's a Epstein is a US intelligence asset that's above my pay grade okay and then we find
out the things Epstein was involved in and we and then we hear the names it would be
part of the court investigation if it went the next day which involves presidents on both the
Republican and Democrat side let lots of other people say so this is the most important court
case in the history of the US where multiple presidents on both sides and you know people
of all kinds of power are possibly going to be indicted for like some of the worst crimes people
can think about and the dude dies in jail on suicide watch and the cameras go off and everything
the day before and we're like okay wait does that mean that there isn't really a justice system
and there isn't really a police system as a part of a justice system and there isn't really news
and the intelligence agencies are part of are involved in things that involve like child sex
trafficking anyone who's paying attention had all those thoughts and then just started doing
other shit again so the topic that comes up for me here is what does it take to think about
better systems and solutions but then what does it take to go implement them and to be
as effective at implementing as
okay if i want to protect the rainforest in south america i have to be more effective
than the multinationals and the national interests behind trying to cut the rainforest down
which is the ccp major chinese multinationals european multinationals some kremlin forces
from super corrupt politicians doing all those types of things where we lose the fucking amazon
if it continues to be some very incompetent NGOs against those forces so if you want to actually
keep it you actually have to be able to out influence them and that's one of the things
that i'm really wanting to see is typically people only start to engage in the game of influence
which is also the game of power if they are oriented towards power seeking in ways that
make them not good stewards of power and the world is fucked from this for people who are
trustworthy who could be good stewards of power groups who could be they will not for their
own intrinsic reasons be oriented to want to do that but the ones who could for the collective
good be willing to step up into that shitty life of engaging in the game of power because it's
actually good for the whole that is one of the critical things that is needed for the world to
make it right now and that's neither new systems oh so i went off that's neither like there's triage
work there's fix the existing systems there's make new better systems but all of them require
being able to move stuff effectively at a global scale yeah i think uh one thing you know like one
thing about the sense making apparatus like if you like an elephant uh in the brain when henson
kind of points out to why uh kind of like his work on predictions why he thinks that it has never
been picked up and it's basically like people don't want to know uh what's going to happen because
that means that people could have predicted wrong which means you can hope people are accountable
for having predicted wrong and for having made wrong decisions and people don't really want that
they just want to kind of collectively treat themselves and signal to each other that they're
trying to do the best but meanwhile no one actually really cares whether anything kind of like uh
whether anything gets done and like and i do worry you know that even if we had really good
sense making uh apparatus is like you know metabolism and a few other tools already out
there that are really quite fantastic but they seem to not be coupled to actuators right and and you
could say well either way you kind of like wake up the establishment so that they should be using
something like a futile key a futile key um futile governance system or we try to kind of like do
better ourselves which you know then again comes to the point of like who's willing to step up within
our community is to kind of like take the deep forward and do that uh you know and and and i think
actually meanwhile i mean you know just i think it came out today or yesterday or something right
like twitter and facebook just like now cooperating with a cdc and with a who or something to to try
to make sense of like fake news posts um about about covid 19 which then tricks people uh and
having less and less trust in any type of sense making apparatus anymore that's kind of like vaguely
in the mainstream right and people just getting more and more down the conspiracy alley because
you know as you said within the abstein case like it doesn't really seem like anyone can be
trusted anymore of the who and another like you know organs are telling you like one day
like don't wear mask the next day totally wear mask and like it's it's all super confusing it's
really really hard to kind of like figure out who to trust but i do actually think that this community
has this intrinsic benefit of like being able to have have called the shots really really early
um and so you know i i just want to kind of like maybe uh poke a little bit more on that you know
what would it you're already saying well it is almost a property of those people who should step
up to do something that they inherently don't want to um and uh and and that those who want to
may not be the right people who should who should do it so uh how do you incentivize those people
if at all or like you know what are specific kind of like projects that you think uh could
require a leader right now what do you think would be good people to take something on like you know
if you're talking quite locally and quite actionable like what what would you like people
in this community focus on more and then you know maybe we can also set amongst ourselves and take
that on i would be very unheartened if the rationalist community and the community
started to use words like sacred and devotion more
and not as a kind of it intellectually makes sense that there is a thing that we can define
this way semantically and or it's a signally kind of thing but from having experiences of
and i i don't mean to define them in some kind of pre-rational religious way but
sacred what is most precious what is most meaningful to me and what is meaningful to me more than my
own experience in my own life and why is my own experience in my own life even meaningful and
what does that tell me about the value of life and experience as a whole and then in light of that
what am i what is my devotion to and to not just what has the best utility function um
um they move in different parts of us and you have to do both
if you read the Tao Te Ching as a book of leadership it basically says in many different ways
the person who really wants to lead everybody should run away from because there's something
wrong with that guy um and they're probably basically psychologically a child and the person
who really really doesn't want to lead and everyone pushes into the position because everyone
trusts them from how they show up as long as that person doesn't start to identify with the
world too much they can probably do an r.h. job um but you asked how do we kind of push people
there i would say if people meditate on what is actually sacred to you what do you want your
life to be in service to what do you really understand is going on in the world right now
and let that be more of what has your attention than your to-do list or your facebook feed
then there'll start to be a sense of what you can't not do and it's not just for
you know personal disposition but what the greater collective need and what's meaningful
calls you to yeah i mean i think you know the rationist and i've never been there but
have the secular sources for example right and and i do think that that kind of like feeling
is something that i want to tap into with existential hope like as he created this website
with like positive visions for humanity and like it's more like a philosophy um kind of like um
blog really that i think because if you if you talk to many people that have done incredible
things they have done them because they've read very early very inspiring uh stuff that never
that they could never forget about right like it came from this like total uh kind of like
internal admiration for this incredible future that that that they could see or for this you
know really like an incredible kind of like almost like aesthetic flow state uh or something that
that came from an intrinsically positive uh place and i think that's an incredibly um kind of like
stable uh motivator right that it doesn't you know it like it doesn't make you it doesn't make you
stop very very very very quickly right and so i think having that and having that in community
i think is uh is really motivating for us i i would kind of like i i worry a little about you
know like electing like the the global leader i think you know one thing that we also often tend
to talk about in the communities is like well it took us a really long time in history to
kind of like stop asking who should be in power but to start asking more like you know what kinds
of architect decision architectures can we create uh kind of like which empower more people right so
even there i think you know this kind of like um tendency of electing you know the the right person
you know maybe we can we can do a little better than that if we get the right architectures in
place and i'm i'm curious whether you know you could point to a few specific kind of like i guess
like cooperation architectures or ways in which you think people are already cooperating well
that we could model off
it seems to me that you allison are personally working your ass off to make these videos available
to everyone that you're personally taking a bunch of leadership initiative during this time to make
a more beautiful future that you feel inspired to do and that you care about and everybody's
wouldn't be here if you weren't doing that and everyone is appreciating it and they're not all
taking equal leadership and making it happen don't get confused that decision architectures to come
about still don't take people taking leadership action to make them happen like who the fuck
figures out the decision architectures who implements them who gets people involved that's
always like inspiration on the behalf of some people that makes those things happen so don't
underweight that um that is that can be a bridge to people saying i'm going to take leadership
not to hold leadership forever i'm going to try and take some leadership to create things that
help everyone be able to participate in leadership in more democratized and better ways and that is
the healthy right kind of leadership the right kind of leadership is i will use some asymmetric
influencer power in a way that tries to increase everyone else's access to be able to do that as
well rather than to continue to increase my own asymmetry of power over everyone else
that's the what i would call legitimate versus illegitimate power and so what i'm proposing
is that legitimate power has a necessary function in moving us to a post illegitimate power dynamic
world all right taking that and um kind of acting on it by unmuting a participant who has a question
max you had a question i'm gonna meet you now
hi daniel hello um are you going to relaunch the americans project and if so please or if not
please could you present the main thesis thesis slash aims for members of the hive that are
unfamiliar with it thanks the emergence project was a name of some kind of
research and aspirations i was engaged in like a decade ago which is just part of this ongoing
thread for me of how to understand the nature of the problems in a way that gives rise to better
solutions and implement them that was a that was a particular point in time with a particular set
of collaborators and the work the insights advanced a lot since then um so i wouldn't say
relaunch that i would say that was a step in a lot of steps for me
they were you know like i started with activism young and there were certain problems i really
cared about and then i saw that the projects working on solving those problems just moved
the problems and caused other problems and you know like i very personally saw that like we worked
to get fences around to preserve for elephants in africa but it didn't address the underlying
poverty and basis of why there were poachers so the poachers started moving to hunt the mountain
gorilla and the white rhino both of which were more endangered and i'm like fuck we just worked
super hard to make the world worse because we just had more endangered animals get poached and i
started looking at all the places where that happens i'm like it's pretty much everything
because we we defined the problems too narrowly and so our solution to a narrowly defined problem
ends up externalizing harm in other areas so i started looking at more and more of the problems
how they interconnected and then are there underlying generators that give rise to them
and then also how are they are there things that are getting worse which got me in the
catastrophic and existential risk and then i'm like man there's so many fucking catastrophic
risks if we solve the top 10 we'd only buy like 10 years because there's thousands of them they're
all driven by the same generator function so we can't just deal with them all kind of as instances
