we have to deal with the whole class so that led me to thinking about why do humans use white
what is it about human architecture human behavioral architectures it has us keep developing
more power and using it badly and what would it take to be able to not have us be bad stewards of
power technological power using it badly on purpose warfare and rivalry and whatever or
using it badly not on purpose meaning just externalities but you know they have cumulative
effects on that scale so that gave rise to this kind of generator functions of existential risk
work and then thinking about are there categorical solutions to those generator functions that make
a new civilization model the kernel of a new civilization those a bunch of years of work to
kind of figure out what are there and can we define a necessary and sufficient set of design
criteria for a civilization that can have exponential tech and not self-terminate
we came up in that research the answer is yes that there is actually architectures that are
possible there doesn't mean we'll get there they're hard but there are possible things
so then there was how do we work on building that and then also the next step was well
that's going to take generations and we don't get there currently if we don't do a whole bunch of
the you know triage work and working to change the current institution so what kind of both
intelligence and influence needs to happen so that's kind of the progression of
interests and projects and emergence project was one kind of step in that inquiry
I just shared a civilization emerging which I got at least quite a work from you from
I'm hoping that is one of them like another let's say data stage in that in your projection
and maybe I mean it's now 7 p.m. so what we usually do is like whoever wants to stay on stay on
but now I always want to give kind of like panelists like an easy way to bow out
and be mindful of your time maybe I mean you're super welcome to stay on I'm sure there's a
ton of questions but you know maybe as the final words or as words to lead on to into a next
discussion kind of like what are kind of like things that are currently on your mind what are
kind of like next things that you will be focusing your attention on tomorrow and the days after
and just for context if people go there civilization emerging was a blog I put up a few years ago
put a few articles on and then haven't put anything on it in several years and there's like a new
economic series part one two three four it was supposed to be an eight-part series so I described
several parts of what's wrong with economics and then never get around to finishing explaining
what to do with it because there's other stuff that became a higher priority
there's maybe still some value in some of it most of the stuff that I've been focused on
doesn't have a particular public face because not all projects benefit from a lot of attention
but there is a project that I'm working to
get over the line that will have a public face and that I would be very interested in this
community's feedback on and participation with which is a
basically a site that will be trying to help correct the information ecology in the epistemic
commons by doing both being able to vet the information space for the information that has
highest confident intervals and most significance and being able to share that in the right form so
kind of not news but meta-news but then also being able to show the epistemic process by which we
come to that so people don't just get better information to do sense making but better information
processing capabilities so sometime in the next month or so beta version of that should be up
and I look forward to hear people's thoughts on it very cool yesterday we had two models out here
one on infinity project which is like a kind of like way in which we could model the whole economy
and then the other one by Jamie Joyce was on here on COVID-19 argument chains from COVID-19
I don't know if you guys have connected but maybe that would be useful a point of touch base on as well
okay I want to give you the chance to kind of like to gracefully bow out here and meanwhile
you're also very very welcome to stay on I'm happy to I'm happy to hop off if people like to talk about
things when the speaker leaves but I'm also happy to stay and answer questions if that's desired
well we'll happily take you okay next one up we had Diego Diva I'm gonna mute you you had a
bunch of questions and I think the last one that you posted here look look quite good and I'm gonna
unmute you now all right so first of all I want to say that I'm a big fan of all the stuff that
I've been amazed by your videos and thoughts and so on Daniel the second my question is
historically the entities that became civilization like and became super organisms they're
religions and I'm curious if you have any ideas of how to create anti-rivorals or a game beish
religion like structures and what advantages and disadvantages there are in kind of co-opting or
hijacking the religious aspect of the brain in order to you know steer a burgeoning civilization
in that way yeah um it's actually really worth studying the religions that had some meaningful
endurance and were less directly violent so studying the Quakers studying the Jews like
there's some very interesting things regarding how those collective intelligence systems worked
Jews specifically being a diaspora not having a physical location to defend or to be able to
rest upon had to create this kind of decentralized collective intelligence system to have synchrony
while being in embedding cultures um so there's yeah there's a bunch of interesting things to study
there and of course we can look at the Jains and the Buddhists and groups that historically had
non-violence as higher principles and you see that like Tibet can stay safe for a pretty long time
until it actually becomes a risk and then it gets taken over by a militaristic force pretty easily right
and so one of the tricky things has been and this is like when you look at one of the things that
blows my mind is looking at the history of Christianity um and saying okay so when we look
at the Inquisition or the witch trials or the crusades or any of the things that said they were
in Jesus's name and then you look at the Gospels of Jesus saying that he who has no sin cast the
first stone like how the fuck did people figure out that piece of mental gymnastics to do that thing
right um so you start to see an evolution and you can see like the Essenes went Jain direction
with Christian kind of ideas and then the crusades went a different direction so it's almost like
the religion is like a memetic complex and it can undergo mutation and some of those will
have it propagate more and defend itself against external forces more typically those are the ones
that move it in the direction of um effective violence not always often so one of the big
questions becomes how does a peaceful culture stay peaceful while not being overtaken by
warring cultures memetically economically or militarily because if the warring culture is
willing to initiate that thing and the peaceful culture loses by default then that doesn't work
but if the peaceful culture to be able to defend itself against a militarized culture
has to reallocate all of its attention to being better at warfare than the militarized culture
it's not a peaceful culture anymore so there is that's a question I spent a lot of time with
and there are some very interesting insights on that but that's like a hole that would take
another conversation right just to mention one thing um I mean the example just cited
they're somewhat isolated biographically so I'm curious if you know are there less
violent militaristic examples or or at least an idea of how to structure a system that isn't
that isolated and still doesn't involve the militaristic ethos this is why I mentioned the Jews
and uh then also even the Quakers when they were say embedded within dominant Protestant
and other religions here in the US so you have ones that were not which is different than the
Amish who stayed isolated ones that stay isolated is one thing but ones that will be embedded within
a dominant culture and interact with that dominant culture and even get positions in the halls of power
while being able to maintain fealty to their um relationships is that's actually a very
interesting study and I will say that none of them I believe are quite adequate you could take the
masons as another example right um which are quite interesting similarly uh and I mean the masons
mostly after the US was formed um so geographic isolation is obviously one factor uh so what religion
we could create on the Mars base is one whole kind of question but the ones that geographic
proximity is one question which is what types of rituals require physical embodiment and the people
to be able to share in that way versus physical isolation which is which ones require not being
infiltrated by other means and other people yeah all right obviously that didn't really answer the
question it just expanded on the question and it's a really interesting topic and we would need
some more time yeah I also I quite like Bert Weinstein's thoughts on uh kind of like on the
evolution of religions and I think I remember um I forgot what I was with uh with Tyler Altman
when we talked about how can we create renaissance from uh from the current uh from from COVID-19
you know we're kind of like going through a few of the kind of like factors that make religions
great and we're trying to kind of like see whether you can kind of like almost uh kind of like
modulate a movement according to those but the problem is that you know like they're really
really hard to kind of like fake you know like many of the things that make them work are kind of
like because we went intrinsically uh kind of like intrinsically by into them it's really
hard to engineer a movement that has the same properties as a working religion I think well
like even the phrasing of can we utilize or hijack that set of dispositions in the brain for some
useful purpose isn't what gives rise to the experience that people have devotion to right
like there is an actual experience of belonging and experience of aspiration to ethics and
numinous experience that is an actual transcendental operator as opposed to simply an omniscient
operator thinking about a transcendental operator um so it's a it's a different thing
someone doesn't have to have sloppy metaphysics to be able to understand phenomenology
um right but you can also design it right like Muhammad probably was less Muslim than whoever
came four generations later because they were raised in it from where they are on so their
phenomenology is more entangled with the system than whoever designed the system and wrote the
so we could be the designers if not the faithful
I think it's very interesting to explore religions that emerged from authentic depth of
insight and experience that weren't seeking to be religions and yet the depth of experience and
insight about the human condition was meaningful enough and compelling enough that it had some
organic growth versus ones that were intended to gain power oftentimes for political purposes
and that were thinking about how to hijack different kinds of group think and belonging
and superstition and the different dispositions that those things will take I think is also
another very interesting inquiry all right thank you we're going to give a few and make
the chance for a few other participants to ask the questions south had another question south
I'm with you hi um can you guys hear me okay yep yeah um so I was just wondering um so Daniel
talks a lot about how you should uh think about the problem in depth to make sure that you don't
by implementing solution you don't cause other externalities um is there is there like a like
a balance to be had between uh between how much time you spend uh thinking about a problem versus
implementing because for example you can spend your whole life thinking about something to
try to implement a perfect solution to it but then in the end you won't be as as effective
as uh if you maybe implement a partial solution then kind of figure things out along the way
yeah so
sometimes the only way to actually figure out what the externalities are is to start to experiment
or to figure out how it works is to start to experiment and but the key is do I need to do
safe to fail probes and safe to fail um type experimental environments and it's going to
depend upon the degree of consequentiality so it's like what is the externality consequence
of this thing and what type of I'll tell you how I think about it it's what is the complexity
in terms of like total number order of magnitude of interactions of the situation
we're trying to interact with so let's say I'm looking at doing some biotech thing in humans
there's going to be a lot more total complexity of biological interactions that can occur than if
I'm trying to change something in a computer chip and so I think about how many what how many orders
of magnitude of interactions are here and what how many orders of magnitude have I considered
so that's one thing I'll think about is the the phase space of likely interactions relative
to what I've thought about and if that's even within rough powers of 10 I'm at least thinking
about it then I think about as best I can what are the consequences at least that are in the
second order and maybe some bit of the third order set that I can think about and the more
consequential those are also the better we want to have thought about it and the more we want to
roll it out in a progressive process so if I'm thinking about oh I just created some
self-replicating synthetic biology let's release it in the backyard and see what happens
that's a dumb idea right because the I I don't know what the externalities are going to be and
it could be that I just released gray green goo and it kills everything do I release it in a certain
kind of BSL for laboratory environment to be able to witness what's happening right like that would
be the the let's actually find out what it does because we can't just think about it we have to
experiment and get into the medium itself now if I'm looking at a hybridized crop where I just
bred a couple crops together the total amount of genetic change on that compared to a genetically
modified crop versus synthetic biology are going to have me want to do different degrees of safety
analysis so like when I think about with COVID and drugs that could help if we take a drug that's
been around for a really long time like hydroxychloroquine or methylene blue or ivermectin or whatever
drugs that we've had for 50 or 70 years and used in millions of people and have a huge amount of
long-term safety data on and now I'm just looking at are they effective I'm doing efficacy studies
I might be willing to expedite to speed up that research more than a new drug that we don't have
long-term safety data on because I might say oh well it didn't cause any major consequences in the
two months I did the trial but it's because it's but it might be causing consequences that have
delayed biological reactions to show up a year or two years later so if I already have long-term
data on safety I can do faster stuff on efficacy so I'm much more willing as from a policy perspective
to expedite FDA authorization on long-term existing drugs than new ones and I'm also more
willing to expedite drugs than vaccines because the like a small molecule drug isn't intended to
have an enduring effect whereas a vaccine is actually intended to modulate the th1 th2 systems
for years or decades or permanently and so long-term safety studies are actually more
important than something that I'm anticipating will have a longer term effect so that's an example
of like based on how much we already know that's adjacent and what basis for concern about risk
is there what degree of appropriate research would need to come in place
um I think that brings me back to like one question that I think we were almost new
into at the beginning of this which is you know given the kind of like
kind of like incredible really failure of response that we've seen I think you know in the U.S.
and you know can we how do you best make sense of that do you think that is just
plain incompetence or do you think that there's kind of like some something more under the hood
than many of us you know like maybe don't don't like to see it
do I think that
everyone who is in a position of influence has maximally good motives and that any lack of
effectiveness is simply a result of incompetence I think that's just silly when you frame it that way
right do I think that every major politician and different countries that are warring over power grabs
and uh everyone working in who would benefit from surveillance tech and who would benefit
from a collapse of the economy do I think that all the people who have major influence and could
influence institutional response really just want to save all the lives they can make everything as good
as they can keep the market from crashing and you know keep all the jobs intact and the only
reason we didn't do a better job is just incompetence I think that's just silly
I think that we have people who are in positions supposedly on behalf of some larger thing but
there is a conflict of interest where it's actually on behalf of whatever their personal
interests are and they're advancing those agendas now does that mean there is one coordinated
cabal conspiracy at the top no it means that there is a decentralized
set of opportunistic power grab incentives combined with having to do enough towards the
thing they're supposed to do that they don't get kicked out of their position and do I think
that there's an even distribution on how sociopathic everyone is no there's a there's probably a
Gaussian distribution on that um but no I think saying that you know obviously very few people
needed to die from COVID had we been paying attention in December and early January and
doing effective responses and we didn't need to fuck the whole economy and the food supply chains
that need to get damaged did all those things happen just because all of the nation states
