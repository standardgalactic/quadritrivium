Welcome everyone to this session of the Foresight Existential Hope Group.
My name is Lou. I'm the coordinator of this group whose premise is that we live at a very
high stake, special time in the history of the great human projects,
one where things could change drastically.
Technology is developing exponentially faster than perhaps our brains, our societies,
our institutions can absorb safely, and this is creating problems, the greatest of them all being
the threat to the very existence of humanity and our civilization.
And to quote the Continience Project website, which we are going to discuss today,
what we need is fundamentally new problem solving and coordinated choice making
capacities that are adequate to address the complexity, the scale, the rate of change,
and the significance of the novel issues we face.
With the Existential Hope Group here, we have given ourselves the ambitious task to create
the most beautiful futures we dare to imagine. Futures of radical abundance,
of flourishing for all, for life, for the biosphere, we want to expand the boundaries
of human knowledge to unfathomable lengths and to accelerate the technologies that can
manifest those futures. But we acknowledge the need to remain careful, deeply conscious,
and level headed in this quest. This is no place for blind optimism,
or we will fall into the precipice. So we walk a delicate line.
We sure do.
In conclusion, of the gazing abyss, our dreams should still be bold and daring.
And ex, hopefully, this is how we build an era of exponential technology that is
constructive rather than destructive. And this is how we build a new civilization,
one that is safe, that is the safety word of its incredible power.
There is no guarantee we'll make it, but if we don't try, we won't succeed.
So I am totally thrilled to welcome a great duo today to discuss strategies to build
collective intelligence that match our ambitions and challenges. Daniel Schmacktenberger, who is
a founder of the Continence Project, and Phoebe Tickel, who is a foresight fellow and advisor
to the Continence Project as well. Most of you probably know Daniel, whose work focused on
long-term civilization design and tries to develop better collective capacities for sense-making,
meaning-making, and more informed choice-making. So Daniel, I mean, I told you that you've been
a great inspiration for my work, and I'm very grateful that you're joining the session today.
Phoebe, as I said, is a foresight fellow, also a dear co-conspirator for goods,
to both you and I, actually, and with moral imagination, has this project that works on
empowering collective imagining and communities, and so is extremely aligned with existential hope
and the perfect bridge between existential hope and the Continence Project. So yeah,
in summary, I am really grateful for this opportunity to bolster both of your missions,
and maybe before we start and get into the meat of this discussion, I just wanted to say that one
of the central tenets of the existential hope approach is that when we look at how our society
and culture thinks about the future, there are way too many dystopian visions out there and almost
no positive envisioning. But to quote Lucille Clifton, we can't create what we can't imagine,
and so before we dive into problem-solving concrete strategies and the Continence Project,
I would love to hear from both of you briefly what is your most ambitious,
deep and exciting vision for the long-term future? Let's say if we solved existential risks and
achieved existential security, what would happen? What could it look like? What are the possibilities?
Another way to frame this question, at least for me, the way I understand it, is almost
what drives you to so much reflection, work, effort to build the civilization in your words,
Danielle, that is not self-terminating. Why so much work? And beyond what are the
futures that inspire you? Where do you draw your motivation from? So yes, maybe any of you feeling
ready and excited to share first? Bibi, do you want to go first? I think you should go first,
Danielle. Sure, I'm happy to. First, thank you for inviting me here today. I kind of can't
believe that I haven't been to this group before understanding what the mission is and how it's
framed. The framing is beautiful, like it. There's a lot of things that I often talk about that
sounds like I don't have to talk about here because they're already givens, but the way you
framed the unique power that exponential tech gives and how do we become safe stewards for it,
I think, is a really great framing. And when you said there's a lot of dystopic futures,
but not that many positive ones, these positive ones are just silly. They fail quite obviously,
or they depend upon magic, dilithium crystals and warp drives or whatever. So it's how do we have
ones that don't depend upon things that we can't depend upon, that don't hit obvious failure modes
and where there's an enactment path from here to there, because oftentimes the enactment issue
requires more violence than makes that in-state actually possible to change where
entrenched patterns are. I think it's a great thing for the group to be focused on.
A lot of people think, okay, let's say that we were to ensure a post-exrisk world of existential
security. Now the whole focus is we get to become a higher Kardashev scale civilization and go spread
out through the galaxy, or we get to do advanced transhumanism and solve life extension and fuse
our consciousness with the cloud and the AI, or none of those inspire me actually. Those are fine,
maybe we do some of those. But I'm actually not inspired by getting somewhere in particular.
Like this might, I don't know, this might be a strange way to start it off, but yes,
what I'm motivated by, I am motivated by the beauty of life that already is just
continuing to get to flourish. I'm motivated by moms getting to keep falling in love with
their babies and kids getting to discover nature and trees and fall in love for the first time
and study the beauty of poetry and mathematics. Like it is prima facie meaningful. It doesn't
need to go anywhere in particular. It does also have an evolutionary process. There's a becoming,
but it's not a becoming towards some omega point. It's just the process of becoming.
And the meaningfulness of that is grounded in the being of it. That's the thing that I'm ultimately
care about and am in service to. And it's not a given at this given particular time that that
does get to continue here. And it's also not a given that it gets to continue as well. Obviously,
it's not equally beautiful to be born into all situations. And so to the degree that we have
been born into situations that give us some capacity to possibly be able to affect the
future that other people will be born into. That's meaningful.
Awesome. Yeah. There's already extraordinary amounts of beauty all everywhere around us.
I totally resonate with that. Okay, TB, want to share?
Yes. Very happy to share. What an amazing way to kick off a conversation with Daniel, who
yeah, I love thinking with and being in conversation with and with this amazing community that I'm
having the chance to discover more and more through the honor of being a fellow. So yeah,
very, very pleased to be here. Lou, when you asked me this question, you kind of primed
me a little bit with it. And I sat thinking about it for like a good 20 minutes, just thinking about
when you asked me like, what is the future that really motivates you? And I realized that
there's something inherently creepy about projecting a future that I think is good
onto the lives of people I've never met yet and who are not yet born. Like I really sat with that
and I was like, that's just such a meta way to answer this question. But that's honestly what
came up. And actually, I came to something quite similar to what Daniel said, which is this kind
of a future, a future that looks good to me, because I can only really project a desirable
future that feels good to me, I don't want to project that on others. But it is a society and
civilization that is based on wisdom and based around wisdom. And for me, wisdom
really comes down to two things. The first is sacredness. And when I say sacredness,
I don't mean like worship or something religious or even spiritual doesn't really feel like the
right word. For me, sacredness is being in touch with the cosmic reality that is being
like a conscious being alive in this moment on earth and just like the crazy amounts of
like statistical chance that this is happening. And that right now, all of our neurons are firing
in a way that we're able to communicate, we're not even in the same physical reality. Like it's
just like every moment, there's just like so much incredible meaning and richness. And I feel as if
the way we've organized our society today, actually actively wrenches us away from that
all the time. And this is actually why conciliance is such an exciting project for me and why I'm
involved as an advisor and love love the work is like being dragged away from that
realization and lived experience of the sacredness of all life is partly, you know, to do with the
sovereignty of like the epistemic sovereignty of being able to be a sovereign individual who can
be free in the moment to feel and think what they wish to and not be bombarded and manipulated by
advertising or algorithms that are kind of pulling your attention or even just like artificially
constructed scarcity that create these states of being that pull us out of that sacredness. So I'd
say something something like sacredness and sovereignty. But I really have no idea what that
future looks like, whether it's on the earth or on moon or underground. I mean, who knows, like
who knows, like the actual physical what is very unclear to me and I'm and I'm not
I'm quite suspicious of anybody who has like an ideology of what the future should look like. So
hope that wasn't too meta an answer. No, no, totally resonate with that too. And
yeah, I don't think anyone knows what it will look like. But for sure, I think the trajectory to get
there is not going to be boring. Anyway, so thank you. There was like a really, really appreciate
the priming the session with this and also resonate with both of what you said greatly.
So now that we know what we are fighting for, let's dive into the pragmatic and the concrete
solutions. Daniel, what are the concrete solutions that are proposed by the Continence
Project and how what are the goals and how do we reach them?
There's a there's a step or two in between
concrete goals and how we reach them and what is most
spiritually motivating where we started. Let me see if I can try to do that first.
So you talk about existential hope as a kind of
reframe of existential risk. What would a future that is post existential risk and
and what would a transition process be that would get there. So I'll just speak about existential
risk for a moment because if we're going to make a civilization that makes it, we have to make sure
that it doesn't fail from any of the fail cases. And it takes only any of them. There's this asymmetry
where any of the existential risks happening and the civilization doesn't move forward to not happen
there to move forward. They have to all not happen. So we have to understand
not just the whole ex-risk landscape, but what about the patterns of human behavior at scale,
the patterns of markets and the nature of how we create technology and the nature of how we do
governance and decision making, orient towards catastrophic and existential risk,
and don't orient towards solving it that well so that those are the things that we're looking at
solving to find kind of categorical solutions. And the first thing I'll say and I am sure this
obvious here is people have faced civilizations have faced existential risk for a long time
historically, but they were only local, right? They faced it in war and they faced it in famine
and sometimes in natural disaster. And in fact, every previous civilization doesn't still exist.
They all failed from either internal civilizational decay issues or, you know, outstripping their
environment or being overthrown or something like that. It's just we never had the level of
technology that allowed a global existential risk to be a real thing until the bomb. And
for most of us, the bomb was before we were born. So it seems like a long time ago, but
in terms of the arc of history and obviously in terms of evolutionary time, it was like a second
ago. And so we have to get that when we think about the actual possibility of global existential
risk or even radical regressive civilization. Maybe there's some humans, but we kind of lose
civilizational progress. It's a super new phenomena. And to really get the sense of like the couple
things that we have to factor right now. Up until the bomb, adjacent powers and particularly
adjacent major powers always fought wars. There were never really long periods where they didn't
fight wars. And so when you study the history of Europe or you're studying history in general,
it's a history of largely inter-kingdom, inter-nation, inter-tribal, depending upon where you go,
warfare. And with the bomb, we had this, we had the situation where we could never fight wars
again between major powers. We could fight proxy wars. We could fight asymmetric wars.
And so that was a really radically new situation that the world couldn't use the only problem
solving mechanism for border disputes that it had always had as a last resort against other
things. And the Bretton Woods world was the answer, which is nation states alone don't prevent
world war. We've seen that twice. We can't have world war again. We need some international
structures, the UN, the World Bank, the whole Bretton Woods agreement process,
that can make it to where we're so economically interdependent on each other through globalization
and global supply chains that it's never more profitable to war than to not war,
where it would damage us to go to large scale war, and where we can grow GDP so much that
everybody can get more without having to take it from others. This is the very highly positive sum
game theoretic dynamics decreasing violence. You fast forward 75 years and you run running
that kind of globalized supply chain and seeing what that did to population and resource consumption
per capita and cumulative environmental effects. You start hitting all the planetary boundaries
and you can't run that thing anymore. And you get to the place where almost all of the
commodities that we depend upon are built over six continents of these kind of vast supply chains
where something like COVID happens in one area and you get cascading failures across agriculture
and shipping and tech and finance across the whole world. So you get fragility that highly
interconnected system also means that failures in one place can cascade. And so for a number of
reasons we're kind of at the end of the Bretton Woods answer. And now we need an answer that
still doesn't have war because now we don't just have the bomb, we have many existential weapons,
many different catastrophic weapons. And there aren't just two actors that have them. There's
lots of actors including non-state actors that have them. So we still need a no war solution,
but it can't involve radical growth of material, linear materials economy through GDP and increasing
fragility of supply chains. And so now we need a new thing and there's no precedent for it.
And because we have a fully globalized civilization, we need a civilization that doesn't
fail and there's no precedent for that. And so how do we make a civilization that doesn't fail and
how do we make a civilization that doesn't need war and whose answer for not war doesn't cause
those other risks? Those are like new questions that we have to answer that previous civilizations
figured some parts out, but definitely didn't figure these things out. And when you say safe
stewards, like that's a really key way of thinking of all of the x-risks that we face are mediated
by tech. If we had stone tools only, none of them would exist. If we were in the Bronze Age,
none of them would exist. And so the question is if tech is extending our choice making power,
what types of choices do we have to make for the choice making power to actually be viable and
thriving long term? And I don't know if people here have had these conversations or heard where
I've talked about it, but we have a world where we still model ourselves as apex predators and
then using social Darwinism and game theory. But we're not apex predators because of tech.
That's kind of the key insight is an orca can eat one tuna at a time and we can put out a drift net
and take up a whole school full of tuna. That's not an apex predator. We can move to every environment
and become the apex predator in every environment they can't. But we're in a multipolar trap of
if we don't behave like the apex predator somebody else does, meaning they will do the tragedy of
the commons or the arms race thing, get so much game theoretic advantage in near term that we then
fail in the long term. So everyone is racing in kind of multipolar traps, applying apex predator
theory, but with something more like the power of gods in terms of being able to destroy species,
create new species, destroy ecosystems, make an Anthropocene. So, you know, the myth of poetic is
with the power of God, you have to have the love and wisdom of gods to guide it. And this is Phoebe's,
you know, wisdom and sacredness. The love is the recognition of the sacredness or the intrinsic
meaningfulness of life. And wisdom is the how do I think through what and feel through what right
choice and in acknowledgement of that sacredness looks like. And obviously, the market system
doesn't do that adequately and none of our kind of global systems do. And that makes sense. So,
what the Consilience Project is aiming to do is to describe the current problem landscape
in a clear enough way that the design solutions for what are the adequate problem solving processes
we need to implement to be able to address all of the existential catastrophic risks and
sustainable development type goals, the things that require global coordination that we're mostly
completely failing at. Like why are we orienting in a way that causes those problems in the first
place and that is almost completely ineffective at solving them. And ineffective at solving them
looks like either we don't solve it at all or we solve one problem and displace harm,
externality to some other problem in the process. And because somebody's probably going to recognize
we're going to externalize harm in the process, they're probably going to fight it. And so then we
have groups fighting to stop each other from doing whatever it is that they're trying to do because
they're optimizing some beneficial metric at the expense of something else. So, what we're aiming to
do with Consilience is to say, okay, the founding fathers didn't have the problem landscape we have,
so it's not in the Constitution. Mark's didn't. The Scottish Enlightenment thinking of market
theory didn't. Even the Bretton Woods folks didn't. So how do we understand this problem
landscape well enough to say what are the new kinds of problem solving coordination processes
have to do? What do the new institutions have to do? And for those institutions to not come
about by imposition, which is its own fail case, they have to arise from people who understand it,
want it, and are capable of participating with it, which is what is the future of open society in the
kind of exponential tech digital age? And so then what is a culture in terms of what people would
have to value that they would invest in their sense making, meaning making, choice making
capacities in this way. So framing that up kind of theoretically, and framing up situational
assessments of what's going on in the world currently in light of that social theory is a
major part of what we're doing. And so people might have heard of Consilience in terms of a media
point of view. And it's because if you want to run a democracy or an open society, if you're
going to have governance, it's a form by the people that you have to have education, high
quality education and high quality fourth estate or news and kind of media as prerequisite
institutions, because the people have to be able to make sense of the world and they have to have
good information. And the complexity of the types of problems we need to deal with has
gone up radically and the quality of education, the fourth estate of both eroded. And so we're
going to be addressing some issues in that are driving culture wars in terms of the perverse
incentive and technological effects and whatever in the media space. We're not going to try to fix
that we couldn't that has to be a decentralized effort, we're going to try to spec out what should
a fourth estate do, what does it have to do, what could it look like in a post digital world as
opposed to the broadcast world? What are the ways in which it has eroded? And what are some
examples or prototypes of what the future of that could look like as a hope to be able to
play a role in catalyzing a decentralized movement of activity towards a renaissance or a new kind
of cultural enlightenment of people thinking much more deeply about how do we adequately restructure
our institutions and upline from that how do we develop our humans in a way that can give rise
to that? I think that's a fair intro. Okay awesome and to get into kind of the
yeah the what we need to do in order to do that you know like the steps and like the modalities
really concretely into the the project I think it would be super valuable for this community and
also perhaps I mean I hope for the continuance project to be for those two communities to be
mutually exposed I think there is a lot of possible synergies between them so yeah like
if you feel like given the broad lines I would be super excited for us all to hear them.
Yeah Phoebe any thoughts before we take the next step?
Um I have a lot of thoughts I mean I have I'd love to hear you talk a bit about you know when
you say cultural renaissance you know what what do you mean by that what does culture mean and
you said it's about people thinking more deeply and um one of the first things that comes to my
mind is um how you know which which people and how and and do you think that everybody in the world
is is capable and wanting to do that culture or that you know thinking that you envision as part of
where where you'd like the world to be? Yeah you were bringing up the question we spoke yesterday
about the different thinkers on democracy and if democracy is a viable kind of idea at all or if
ruling of an elite is actually a necessary thing purely by cognitive capacity and typology or
something like that uh should we address that? Sure go ahead and then I think getting into the
detail of how the project works makes sense maybe yeah next. We don't have to actually try to answer
the hard question of all of the details of how much of typology is intrinsic and how much of
certain capacities are genetic or in some other method intrinsic um what types of Gaussian distributions
are going to be based on biology independent of conditioning is everybody in the future all going
to be thinkers or are there going to be people who are doing abstract thinking and other people
that are doing art and like we could have that conversation but if in if we just want to start
by saying I think the way the conversation is usually framed has some bad assumptions that we
can dispel pretty easily. Are there populations where the entire population over a period of
generations has been radically more educated than other populations? Yes so we can just do
positive deviant analysis look at Jewish culture. Does Jewish culture ensure that there's a much
higher level of education for all of the people in the culture than say the average United
States does? Of course it does and obviously we can look at Singapore, Taiwan, Nordic countries
and be able to do the same thing on a country by country comparison and where it becomes really
ridiculous to think of it as a genetic conversation at that point because it's across the distribution
of the whole population you can also say are there some populations that train all of their
people in virtues differently? We can also see this change on a generational basis within the
same culture so can we get a Buddhist culture where we have roughly 10 million people flexing
populations over three millennia mostly all who don't hear bugs? Yes can we get a child soldier
Janjuid culture in Darfur where to make it to adulthood you probably have to be a murderer?
Yes like human genetics selected for mimetics we selected for the ability to do abstraction which
made language and tool making and the capacity to be very radically different with not that much
consistent baseline so that we could learn how to text as opposed to throw spears or Mandarin as
opposed to English or this environment as opposed to that one or because we're environment modifiers
because of our tools we have to come not fixed with a genetic code of a certain environment
we have to be able to take in the information of this new environment so the flexibility of what
we can do is huge and we've done most of our social science after ubiquitous capitalism and
industrialization and then took it as if that was just a given that oh human nature is this way
and it's just gibberish right it's ubiquitous conditioning and then treating that as if it's
human nature because it's ubiquitous so when you look at the Buddhists or the Jains or some
cultures like that you say can humans can we deal with the innate violent issues of us being
primates and conflict theory stuff better yes we look at Jews and certain kinds of lines of
wealth elite and whatever we say within whole populations can we deal can we do much better
say cognitive education cultural education the answer is of course yes can we do those together
what what is a meaningful human life what are the capacities that we want to develop in humans
what would that look like and then even just go to Exeter Academy or some highly elite private
school where the kids of the elite go do they get a radically better education than most kids do and
do you get it do you get a displacement of the whole Gaussian distribution sure of course there's
some super smart some kids who do really well at public school and some people who do bad at Exeter
but overall one bell curve is displaced two standard deviations from the other bell curve
and so you're like okay well that that's a class issue right that's not a genetics issue that's
not an aptitude or a typology issue that is a access to the kinds of resources issue and that's
not even addressing all the other aspects of culture that are developing people it's just
school and it's not even a good idea of how to do schooling well one of the so can we develop
everybody radically more yes there's just never been an interest in that like class interests have
never wanted that because class interests benefit from a power law distribution and a power law
distribution of power depends upon a power law distribution of access to information and information
processing so asymmetric information equals asymmetric game theoretic power a increase of
the symmetry of information information processing choice making capacity is fundamentally not aligned
with a power law distribution it is the solution to a power law distribution but that also means
it is antithetical to the most powerful interests in it so that's an important thing to understand
in terms of enactment issues one of the very big questions is in we we also didn't give a we never
tried to educate very well the whole population because most of them were going to be laborers
and you're like how much do you need to know about history and civics and game theory and
coordination theory to pave roads all day or to lay bricks all day or to so why are we doing that
additional costly educational investment if there it's not going to be useful to you there's no
roi to society well the the answer and the reason that george washington said uh an all paraphrase
that the most important goal of the federal government is the comprehensive education of
every single citizen in the science of government science of government was term of art then meaning
applying all of the kind of principles of being able to make sense scientific like principles to
what gives rise to government so that was do they know history do they know military theory do they
know the classics do they know rhetoric do they and it's fucking fascinating to get that he that
he said the number one name federal government in founding this country us is the comprehensive
education of every single citizen he didn't say it was maintaining rule of law because if the goal
is maintained rule of law won't be it won't stay a democracy you will start emphasizing
authoritarian power and you'll debase the democracy if if the goal is protecting the borders or
monetary supply or anything else that'll happen and so the only thing that could keep it a democracy
is the comprehensive education of all the people so the idea was even if they're laborers they're
also citizens right they also have a role they have a civic duty and so there's the development
of civic knowledge and capacity and civic virtue necessary to play their role in the governance
they're not only members of the market right and that was the idea in the liberal democracy
is that the citizens are engaging in the market for the innovation thing market does and that's
one of the roles of education they're also engaging in the government that's another one
of the roles and you can see that today almost nobody and you know I know you're in London and
then there's a different but related story to ideals of the British Empire and in England today but
nobody in the US thinks that they really like have a civic duty that they engage in government
they bitch about government out there but they consent to being governed by not being actively
involved they don't even go to jury duty they don't they don't want to pay attention to what the
government is even actually doing governance about right so there there's an education that would
be required to even be able to do that and you can notice that even the value the idea that
civic virtue is a thing kind of died with the boomers as the last generation that thought that
was even a thing but let's come back to the market issue is oh still how much can we invest
in the comprehensive education if we're looking at Exeter Academy relative to most people being
laborers because the people coming out of Exeter Academy and most Jews aren't going to become
laborers right um well this is where the future of technological automation and AI automation and
rote tasks actually as everybody in here I'm sure talks about that either totally sucks and
becomes the most powerful tool of wealth concentration it's ever been because now the people aren't
even relevant as serfs right they aren't even relevant as laborers and that and the wealth of
the technology is owned by the few technology holders in the power law distribution or it
becomes the basis of ending one of the fundamental tenets of the why market theory was the thing
we had to work with which is the jobs that make a society work need people to do them but nobody
wants to spend that much of their life doing certain jobs so either the state has to force them
or how do we make it toward the people also need the job so it self-organizes which means that the
market forces them the ability to make it toward the jobs don't need the people anymore so technological
automation debases the need to have the people have to need the jobs which is where UBI is the
first concept it's not a very good concept you can go beyond UBI to like access to commonwealth
resources generative shared access to commonwealth resources that starts to become possible and
the underlying coordination or motivational game theory starts to change so one of the big
questions in education is in a future that is post information singularity
so you can't actually know all the information on a topic
and that is post I won't say agi because that's actually a very different issue but at least
very good narrow ai applied to everything and robotics so automation what is the role of humans
in that world is there something that humans are still uniquely uh good at and something that's
connected to what is uniquely meaningful and then what is the role of the educational system in
developing those capacities in people and then what is the kind of synthetic intelligence that is
individual human intelligence doing what is uniquely good at humans not us being shitty
computers because right now we largely train us to do shit that ai's are better at so what is
unique to human capacity what are methods of collective intelligence so we can have sense
making meaning making choice making that is synergistic to the number of people that are
engaging as opposed to uh always leads to tribalism and conflict uh and then augmented by computer
intelligence so the system as a whole is a synthesis a synthetic intelligence of human
and machine for the various things they do and human with each other uh so we would say
the governance system of the future has to have those criteria the educational system would be
preparing people for that and uh will everyone be doing abstract thinking about how to continue to
evolve the system equally of course not just like everyone won't be doing poetry equally or
whatever but is there some element of civic responsibility where the rights and responsibilities
have to be paired that if people get rights without responsibilities you get entitled shitty people
if people have responsibilities without rights you have slaves there has to be a pairing and a
growth capacity and rights and responsibilities is there a kind of civic responsibility and so
thus a civic virtue that that responsibility arises from within them as opposed to just being
imposed on them that still has to be there and certain capacities that have to be there for
everybody to participate in governance yes and then to what degree is it customized does everybody
have to understand microgrids well enough to vote on DOE policy no some people will so how do how do
we do that that's a conversation we can get into in detail but I do think most of the assumptions
about what we can't achieve in education and that are are based on things that are either just
narrative warfare not true there's class warfare and whatever or there are things that are about to
go obsolete awesome super interesting thank you for this also again like primer
yeah I mean I guess before yeah I think that that was also like an interesting vision for the future
and hopefully you know we can we can try to strive for these goals
I guess now I kind of want to ask like how how do we get there and you know what is the
the strategy of the continuance project just because I mean that's one of the the ideas with
this group is often to try to elevate the projects and the humans who drive them who are like trying
to fix things at the moment but yeah I really appreciate actually like I didn't see the value of
everything you you just described and yeah I mean you can tell that I like discussing the
fundamental theory and that's the continuance project is actually doing that better more
formally across lots of things we were just discussing the role of education why education
has been hard some what positive deviants in education are what the future what the future
role of education could be etc all of those topics deserve being addressed better because
a lot of the ways that we think about problem solving have assumptions that either we're never
true or or we're true but are no longer true and so what I'm kind of doing where we're speaking
through that so that hopefully we can think better together about uh how to design a better
future the continuance the core of the continuance project is actually doing that function much better
so basically you we have uh I'll kind of break it down we have two major arms there's a publishing
effort and there's a movement building effort and it's just starting if you go to continuance
project.org you'll see the very beta version of the site we put up a week ago a few days ago
and start with the about us page like it's it's really beta if I
if I had my brothers we would work on it for six more months before it was up at all
there's about a half a dozen or so initial articles on there and a half a dozen more will
be up here shortly but I'll go ahead and describe so publishing and movement building
first I'll say something about the project it's a non-profit uh it's committed to be a pure
non-profit so no revenue streams it will never sell any of the information or hide it behind a
paywall it'll never sell anybody's data for marketing purposes it'll never put an ad on the
site because all of those um would corrupt the information ecology in some ways and we're trying
to help the information ecology and the epistemic commons actually like stewarding those needs to
have no dual master's issues no other thing we're optimizing for so we're also not measuring our
success in terms of number of clicks or number of shares or anything like that because basically
any of those metric sets you would optimize for become paperclip maximizers in some way
so
and then the project ends in five years so five years from a week ago and
uh we intentionally sunset it because it makes it very clear that it's not seeking a position
in the long-term power landscape it doesn't want to be a major media player or directing government
or anything like that so it's not an interesting place to come for power seeking ladder climbers
and anyone who wants to do good work in any adjacent space knows we aren't a competitor
because we don't achieve any of our long-term goals if we don't get lots of other groups
to succeed so when we do our public postmortem in five years at the end of the project
where we succeeded and where we failed a huge amount of our success will be what things we
help catalyze that in or facilitate that are continuing afterwards including lots of other
projects that's the movement building side just a general principle everybody in here should think
about it's not always the right idea to sunset a project but it's certainly a good idea to think
about because um a project's ongoing existence if it's trying to solve a problem can be a
perverse incentive and this happens all the time and this is most of the NGO space if I have a
project emerge to solve a problem if I really solve the problem I go out of business but let's say
I'm the world food programmer I'm some now a large organization where the individuals who make the
choices in the organization because the organization doesn't make choices people do the people have a
lot of fucking power being at the top of it they're incentivized to manage the problem forever
not to really solve it not to lead themselves so the pathological orientation of a system to
keep being itself if it emerged to solve a problem is something you have to factor into the design
up front uh and so does it end at a certain amount of time is there some path to the convergence
towards the solution and then it ends or transitions is there some governance process to
pay attention to that okay so I'll say briefly what the publishing arm is seeking to do with
the movement building arm and then we'll um see thoughts and questions publishing arm there are
three types of basically long form articles we're writing right now and then those long form articles
will be translated into being discussed on podcasts and we're working on making animation
versions so high school students can access them because the because the articles are kind of long
and kind of in depth so they're not something that we think everybody's going to read right now
this gets to Phoebe's question of elite versus everybody the goal is everybody but in steps
there is not one thing you can share that will appeal to the most ardent Trump supporter and
the most ardent Antifa supporter at the same time very well and yet we obviously have to fix that
issue if we're going to have a democracy and be able to coordinate well enough to do anything
and this you know we've talked about this issue before but you know China has already implemented
high-speed trains all around the world and the US hasn't built one yet and we're like what the
fuck why like that's just a one example we could talk about it with regard to building transistors
and and lithography or supply chains or lots of things but it's like why can't we build a high
speed train and why and it has to do with institutional decay and specifically in a democracy
in an autocracy as we can see in China you can get rid of the problem of internal infighting
and just have everybody kind of do the same thing or you can get rid of a lot of it through
imposition of top-down control you can also do long-term planning if you have one person
in rule for a very long time and in the US you're going to have a situation or anywhere where you
have term limits and we know why we have term limits somebody will work on something for four
years the next person will come in and undo that for four years and most of the energy is actually
spent on raising money for campaigning and so it's like you can't do long-term planning in that
situation and almost nobody invests in something that has more than a four-year return horizon
because it won't get them reelected so this is a big deal to say either technologically
empowered autocracy runs the 21st century and that we would argue has its own in fail cases
or we have to be able to have something like an open society coordinate better than autocracy can
coordinate this is now a design constraint of the future how the fuck do we get an open society to
coordinate better how do we get a lot of people to not be stuck in infighting and the way we think
of this is civilizations are a way of coordinating lots of human behavior and people who want different
things and view the world in different ways so they're predisposed to act in different ways
but that are consequential on each other and societies fail either through excessive oppression
or excessive chaos right the oppression chaos kind of thing and what they're seeking is order
and the order is either imposed in which case it moves in the direction of oppression
or if it's not imposed usually you don't get it you get increasing chaos and so we can see in the
US there's almost nothing that everybody even agrees on this fact about COVID hydroxychloroquine
viral origins climate change the reality of systemic racism anything like the base understanding
of fact the base understanding of values almost completely fractured so inability to coordinate
so if you want to have order that is not imposed it has to be emergent how do you get an emergent
order now this is why we get to culture emergent order is does everyone have the capacity to make
sense of the world in a similar way do they have the capacity training orientation interests to seek
to understand how other people are making sense of the world do they have the ability to share what
their values are seek to understand what other people's values are and find then synthesis of
what are all the values to then try to find design solutions that meet all of the values
simultaneously this those capacities which is collective sense making collective meaning
making are what allow collective choice making in an emergent way to create order as opposed to
imposition that is fundamentally a culture process
so coming back there was a long train from publishing so the articles that are the basis of
it are three types of articles there's basically theoretical pieces the foundation series we call
their situational assessments and there's meta-news the theory pieces are things like
what we're talking about here today what is the fundamental role of education to a civilization
what is education really supposed to do it has to do with the intergenerational knowledge transfer
and the generator function of knowledge for the auto-poesis of the civilization and etc so how
do we explain what the fundamental role is how do we explain how the major step functions in
education corresponding to the step functions and the techno-industrial base have have happened
in the past how do we explain the current breakdown of it and what the future of it needs to look like
same thing with general informantness fourth estate same thing with why we can't do nuclear
disarmament and why we can't stop a arms races what is the game theory of multi-polar traps
what would it take to solve them so the theory pieces are framing up and framing up things like
why are we sucking so much and solving climate change well it's because you can't
every solution for climate change has half the world oppose it because it externalizes harm to
some other things that they care about because the problem it's a carbon tax is the solution but
only some countries are going to ratify it and so let's say China doesn't and the US and Europe
does and it damages the GDP of the western nations relative to the other ones win a massive geopolitical
uh grab for powers already there and that increased GDP will be invested in near term control geopolitical
geopolitical military dominance and of course bunch of people will be like no fuck that that's a
bad solution and then they'll say I don't believe in climate change because they don't like the solution
that was proposed and then you say okay well what if we could get China to ratify it well then does
it hurt global GDP in a way that disproportionately hurts the poorest billion in which case they'll
be posing it because the commodity of price of food just went up or increases war because now we
don't have positive some dynamics or so you can't the problem is in climate change the problem is
the relationship between climate change geopolitical power markets energy return on energy investment
of the change of energy infrastructure right you have to think of those things together because
if you try to solve one in a way that's going to externalize harm somewhere else either you
succeed and it's not even worth doing or you don't succeed because half the world is paying
attention to the other thing resists you and all the energy is just wasted as heat um in infighting
so where people think they understand the problems currently they don't they understand a bunch of
separate parts which is why we can't succeed at anything those aren't the problems the problems
are how do they interconnect what are their common generators how do we solve that how do we do more
integrated design solution that's what allows us to get past infighting come up with solutions that
everybody can get on board with so the theory pieces are specking out this space what is the
current novel problem space of the world and what are the types of solutions need to look like what
is the the previous institutions we've had what is where do those break down and what is the future
of those institutions have to look like that's what those are and instead of doing that as a book
or a few big books it's done as a series of articles where each article is long enough deep
enough that someone can understand a principle or a topic deeply enough that they could be part
of the design solution they could be thinking about it but they can also do it in one sitting and
then it's interconnected with the other articles each one will hyperlink to the ones that are
connected to it so there's this interconnected media object that someone can start with education
or start with governance or start with economics or start with x-risk or whatever and then be able
to come into the adjacent spaces the situational assessments are where we're showing the current
issues in the world that we need to understand so describing the great power games that are at play
or describing why anything from the India China border conflict and what it's really about and
what it portends to the emergence of crypto and decentralized finance and what that portends for
traditional finance all those types of situational assessments but where the situation assessment
what we're doing that's novel compared to say foreign affairs or the diplomat or the economist
is we're applying the social theory we're looking at it in terms of multipolar traps or in terms of
coordination failures or the underlying game theory that's involved so people are able to
understand the issues in a different way that also make the theory ground itself in the current
world situation and it would give people some insight into what it would take to change that situation
and then where the situation that we're addressing is fraught meaning that there's a highly polarized
views on it then we do a meta-news thing that describes the media forensics of how those views
came about so like let's say we're talking about climate change and there's radically
divergent views on how bad the problem is if it's real what to do about it etc the or systemic racism
and we can see that people engage in statistical warfare where they all cherry pick their statistics
to make their case well and narrative warfare where they frame the conversation to make their case
so we want to do is be able to say okay well what are the various narratives about this sometimes
it's just a left and right but obviously sometimes the antifa far left and the establishment left
are totally different narratives and similarly cross space so we identify what are the narratives
that are currently trending how do we still manage narrative how do we
argue its case for it as best as it can and identify then what is authentic signal or truth
or real value in it both the values and the sense making then is there anything that is clearly
falsifiable or omitted or missing or framed let's identify that then let's be able to do that across
all of the narratives and then say what can we say synthesizing about the space as a whole
and also show where the way that social media algorithms have have driven that tribalism or
the way that very specific economic actors started paying for media or science of a particular type
or acts of kind of framing that create propaganda narrative or so in reading that the
one of the things that happens is people start to get the aspect of media literacy that they get a
memetic immune system they see that the thing that's being called news and even a lot of what's
being called communication of science is actually narrative and info war for specific economic or
political agendas and they start to recognize the tools of that like cherry picking of data
or decontextualization of a fact which will still make it through a fact checker or lay
cough framing the fact all that will make it through a fact checker and you can still lie
with that stuff so they'll be able to start to recognize that and recognize that they're victims
of a narrative war camp more than they are sovereign thinkers and so the goal is that they
can recognize it and have an immune system against it a memetic you know epistemic immune system
and then also develop the epistemic tools needed to actually make sense of complex topics
uh and the hope is once someone has done that for a few things and they realize that the camp
that they're a part of does say some true things but also they can see where the errors and omissions
or actual narrative war occurred the camp that they thought were total idiots is actually saying
some true and important things they can see that it's not good guy bad guy it's across the whole
space there are there's a competition that creates distortions based on partial truths
or based on partial value sets when they can start to see that and get out of it
then we start to create a new third poll outside of the polarity of people that can operate at the
level of synthesis rather than thesis anti-ceases and that becomes the strange attractor of culture
so those pieces together will all inter-reference each other the meta-news the theory of the
situational assessments and collectively we call that the conciliance papers and the conciliance
papers kind of like you know what the federalist papers were to the constitution a frame of the
issues and a frame of the theory that says this is the type of governance this is a frame for the
world to be thinking about what are the types of solutions moving forward that make sense that
address the the issues that are framed up here to make that more accessible each piece will go on
a podcast and have many different people who are involved dialoguing about different experts and
thinkers in the space will become a simpler article in animation so then you get a trans
media object of all those methods of communication all of this is you know open commons copyright
anybody can use it modify it advance it and the goal is not that we do all the work the goal is
is that other people get inspired to do similar work to disagree it's at whatever great disagree
we go to the points now the conversation about these topics is becoming center of culture
publishing side movement building side is maybe there's a group that is trying to fix journalism
already by addressing perverse incentives and journalism maybe there's a group that's trying
to fix education and improve civics and education maybe there's a group that is working on
supporting parenting to be doing early childhood development well or a group that is working on
solving social media algorithm bias issues we would say those are all actually working on this
cultural enlightenment they're working on facets they might not be framing it that way so we want
to be able to identify the ones that are actually well informed have good strategy and signal boost
them and then reframe those as parts of a shared cultural movement and be able to help more
attention capital resources flow to those projects and be able to help them be seen as
so when the movement starts to become self-aware it is a it's able to start creating better
relationships and knowledge sharing and catalysis and like that that's roughly the
the two branches names the project awesome well thank you so much for the great explanation
and all the context it's very nice to get you know deeper a deeper
development on why this is important I've read obviously a lot on the continence project to
prepare but that there is very useful okay so I have a lot of thoughts and questions but I really
want to hear Phoebe's on what has been just said and also on how as alexanderos asked in the chat
how moral imaginations ties into what has just been described by Daniel I just want to precise that
we will be doing a specific session on moral imaginations and that Phoebe also showed up
in this session as like the advisor to the continence project and foresight fellow
so on it will be actually on May 4 and we will have I mean I'll let you explain Phoebe and what
moral imagination is and what this session maybe might look like and you know if you want to just
go for it and has have any remarks on what Daniel has just said about continence project in general
just just go for it you have the floor thank you yeah it's brilliant to hear you talk about the
project Daniel I mean we've talked a lot about conciliance so but every time I'm you know it's
like stimulating a lot of thinking and framing and I guess for me what it feels like the project
is doing that's really important and needed is this kind of framing like if we think about
the need for movements in this in this next few decades like this the kind of scale of change
that's needed to move from a kind of doomed society and civilization to one that has a chance of
long-term flourishing this this sort of framing I mean you didn't really go so much into the
social theory part of the project but this this thinking and framing and ability to
give people an understanding of what sorts of projects are worth working on and and how to
coordinate and how to make sense within a larger frame of what is needed it's it's kind of like a
meta theory of change is kind of how I've been thinking about it's like offering a meta theory
of change that a lot of more micro theory of changes can kind of self evaluate and and fit
around I also think it's you know I think a really key thing that you you have highlighted and talked
about is this connection between sense making meaning making and choice making and you know
ultimately this being perception and and the ability to make sense of the world the ability to
make good choices and then conciliance also giving you know theories and and thought out
yeah theories and hypotheses on what sort of work is needed
yeah but I'd like to I'd like to hear you go more into the social theory part but maybe we can
come back to that I guess what I am interested in is like I completely agree with with the entire
thesis but the big the big task at hand is like how to how to improve sense making how to how to
you know really build the capacity of citizens in epistemic justice in you know kind of reclaiming
perception you know perceiving complexity being able to do that kind of complex thinking
and so this is really how it connects with the work that I have been doing and I'm passionate
about which is really this capacity building on the practice level and and you know there's a big
question around how do you scale that you know how do you get that kind of work out into the world at
scale and I can go into moral imaginations a little bit but I'm also conscious that as
Lu says we'll have a two hour session on 4th of May where I will offer one of the exercises that
we've developed and prototyped with now 400 people and then we can go into it a little bit and I would
love to you know get your feedback if you want to come to that session and dive into that work and
talk about yeah the potential of it but I can just say on a kind of high level that work for me has
really been inspired by actually diving into the concept of moral imagination which to me is really
about reigniting a movement and I'm really excited about you know this framing of movements
a movement of bringing kind of morals and and virtue I really like this phrase specific virtue
like bringing the that like values of what is important back to the center of what we do
and bringing it alive through a kind of rigor of feeling a rigor of imagination which is a weird
thing because it you know it's like how do you do that how do you do imagination and feeling
rigorously which I think is is a it's a big task but to me that what's interesting to me is how do
we get out of just the theoretical and kind of intellectual level because to me sense making
is embodied and it and it's it's based it's also involving feelings and emotions and perceptions
and and that you know warm data of memories identity who we are the you know the thing I'm
grappling with there is is how to scale that because you know how do you do that is it is it
kind of self-organizing like small groups of local citizens with who are trained or who have
um yeah sort of run sheets or instructions on how to host these processes that that's a whole
question that we can go into um but that those are the kind of questions that I'm grappling with
because I I yeah I think to compliment the work that that Daniel's just been talking about which
which I feel is very much focused on the kind of understanding and framing and and it's quite
intellectual and and feel free to push back at that Daniel or I'd love to get get into that a
little bit but it does feel quite intellectual and I guess one of my questions is how how can
we complement that with uh yeah the shifts in perception and the sense making that requires
kind of depth of experience and shared uh process and um yeah maybe even the collective
doing that sense making together
you notice how it's something like girdles and completeness theorem logic can notice its own
upper boundaries right uh in tarski's theorem it's
a kind of formal logical analysis of the upper bound of what formal logic can do
that a formal system can identify its own validity but not soundness soundness is something
outside of that system so what is that um the idea that intellectual capacities and the values
are separable is like it's not a real thing and I think you know that um to even
invest in intellectual capacity shows a value there's something that one values that creates
that investment right they might value truth or value um they might value knowledge or any kind
of thing but at the basis of it there's some value of truth that has to do with some respect for
reality that is the thing you actually wanted to kind of deepen the awareness and emphasis of
but why we say conciliance right though that that word means being able to take many different
perspectives and different epistemic and values perspectives on the same topic and get different
insights about that topic so you actually get a richer more multi-dimensional understanding
through take many perspectives so rather than the idea that the perspectives are here to debate
or fight with each other and one is going to win it's no we actually want to take all the them that
we can this is the uh this is diversity and then synthesis right um and so if I really value good
sense making I have to value understanding other people understanding their views right which is
why this steelmaning is fundamentally an empathy exercise if I'm going to steelman another view
I'm going to say I'm actually going to transcend tribalism and in group outgroup dynamics and
rather than say those guys are bad because they're saying something that seems threatening or scary
to me and I uh I'm going to actually seek to understand well why would I do that and I'm
just going to try to win whatever the cultural war the political war with them is well because
they don't stop existing when I win this is a this is the short-sightedness of cultural arms races
if I use if I win a political campaign or I win a messaging campaign for the
to you know be able to change some law or some dominance I guess of the thing
the people who feel otherwise don't stop existing and whatever new better
memetic warfare technique tool or um voter engagement process I came up with they reverse
engineer just like actual weapons and then utilize back and what you get is just an
exponential increase in narrative war an exponential increase in cultural war
and exponential war of any type self-terminates and so the idea that you can just like we're
right and good the other ones are wrong and stupid we have to use the best tools to get
everybody to believe in our version of climate change or vaccination whatever the fuck the
thing is that we're sure we're right and good about like that thing doesn't work if anybody pays
attention you get battle wins and an increasing escalation of the consequentiality of the war
as a whole um and so when you start to get that you're like okay is there a way to transcend the
war is there in-group outgroup dynamics are old we we have a tribal origin but tribal warfare
multiplied by exponential tech self-terminate so how do we get past in-group outgroup dynamics
we've unified our in-groups beyond a tribal scale by a shared enemy but you don't get to
keep doing that in a multi-catastrophe weapon world that you can't put mutually assured destruction
on and survive so we need some new method of cohesion that doesn't make enemy that doesn't
require enemies as soon as people start to get that then it's like well we actually have to
coordinate the von Klausowitz said war is politics by other means but the other side of that is
politics or being able to come to coordination agreement with each other is how you sublimate
warfare which is the the other default that you get so if the warfare is too costly you don't
want to do the warfare then I can't just try to beat the other guys right I have to actually
say how do we come to see reality in a similar way and come up with something we can all get on
the same page with and I can't do that if I don't understand where you're coming from if I can't
inhabit the position and if I try to do it with pure rhetoric right like I'm I'm just going to try
to say the words like a GPT-3 algorithm would do it of your position I won't be able to actually
inhabit why that those values matter so much and how your position is going to change when a new
thing comes about when I really inhabit it I start to get the generator function of where
you're coming from so I can come up with solutions that might actually work for you
and I actually care about where you're coming from and so steelmaning seems like this logical
argumentation method and what it really is is empathy across in-group out-group dynamics
to be able to say we actually have to understand the values that everyone is in service of in the
way they under they are seeing the world and we have to understand it in a non-pejorative way
to have a possibility of both seeing truth and coordinating well um so the idea that you could
do an effective intellectual thing without a deeply relational uh and embodied an ethical
thing is actually a fallacy I would say I'm not sure I agree because I think there are people
who do purely intellectual things without deeply empathetic positions all the time
but I appreciate what you're saying is oh it's just they're wrong well sure but I guess the
what you're trying to do is to is to shift culture and to get people in you know to take
take up this kind of new culture of sense making with this care and virtue and I think
does that make sense does that it's that it's not that you can't do an intellectual thing it's
that you won't get the right answers so that even if what you're caring about is true just truth I
don't give a shit about the other people which would be nonsensical because as soon as I realize
if I even give a shit about my thing that I care about I don't want escalating arms races
I get it I I get it and agree what what I mean is like how to shift minds and hearts to that
place to the place that we're both talking about that we need to get to to have this sort of movement
with citizens that's that's the bit that I think I'm interested in well so for for some people
realizing that the in-group win that they really passionately care about is going to fail
in exorbitantly going to fail if they don't get past in-group outgroup that is a motivator to be
like fuck I have to understand those guys I have to and and it's the beginning right because there's
a belief that the current thing will succeed it is a part of continuing to do it so being able to
get that it'll fail and that they have to approach it that way is is a starting point now how do we
now how do we actually get it to happen so this is what we talk about movement building and do you
think about and and I don't mean movement in the way we normally think of movements I mean movement
building more like the the hippie movement is a good example because it had to do with environmental
values and feminist values and environment and globalist values and free love and all kinds of
things it wasn't a specific movement it was a zeitgeist it was totally decentralized who
led it nobody led it John Lennon wasn't the leader you know it wasn't led by um the black panthers
or one green piece they were all parts of it it was a zeitgeist the same as like modernity and
the enlightenment or any of the any kind of enlightenment like that so what we're talking
about is a something that has to become like that so for instance
who's going to read 45 minute articles with big words not everybody right like some people who
are oriented to that and care and then some of them say okay I have a podcast I'd like to talk
about this in a way that makes this available to a lot more people and I know how to speak to the
audience that I speak to or I have a TikTok channel and I read this and I'm just interested and I'm
going to talk to my Gen Z audience or my hip hop audience or my whatever it is because it appeals
to someone who's adjacent to knowing how to do that through art through media through other methods
so we had somebody contact who's working on a rap battle platform with a lot of the top rap
battlers and he's like the reason I'm wanting to do this rap battle platform is because the
rap battle is a way to take the aggressive pissed off rivalrous energy and sublimate it through art
but they can be in it and to be good at freestyle rapping you have to develop language skills
and thinking skills so it's a way to actually create a desire to even to take their anger to
take their ego and have it develop them in some way and sublimate the violence
so he's like well what if we got the best rappers around and that they want to rap on police violence
and racial issues and whatever and you're doing pieces on that that are more comprehensive you
will train them up on those pieces they'll come do this rap battle thing and everyone be like
fuck how did you learn all that stuff how do I learn all that stuff and it starts to create an
incentive within a specific channel and you know you can start to imagine all of the different
subcultural groups having different ways of being approached I would have never thought of that and
there've been a number of other ones like that that I wouldn't think of and that's the point right the
point is you don't have to try to think through all of the steps in in a auto poetic system you
have to say can we put something forward that some people will resonate with and then their
collective intelligence gets to know how do they continue to advance that front so getting auto
poetic collective intelligence can we get something where some more people are more actively engaged
and now the system is smarter that thing converges to where it means to go and I think a key part
of that is also that constituents plans to offer you know innovation prizes and do this kind of
tending and building of resources and capacity of these movements just to dovetail on that and I
kind of want to hand it over to the audience right because there are questions in this slide
over I actually I have a scientific background and so like I really came from like a very analytical
place and I've fully come over to the place where I really believe that sense making and
epistemic justice and becoming more fully human like rests on on the the shoulders of art and
creativity and that's why like that's why you know I'm putting a lot of time into developing
mass collective imagination practices which is totally not where I ever saw myself going but
I don't think we can do this kind of sense making without engaging engaging people on a level that
is like past rational like not just the rational it's also just like the that space that space of
kind of as I said memory identity love you know it's that gray matter goo place which actually
the right wing weaponize is really really well and the left wing really does not know at all how
to work with that at that level um anyway that would be a whole discussion in itself which
I'd love to have another time but so the fact that you say I'm a scientist and I moved into
this place was because of identifying started with the scientists because of identifying the
criticality and utility of science and then you also understood that its upper boundary is smaller
than the problem space and so it's necessary it's not we're going pre-science right it's
necessary but not sufficient and so you're saying what additional human capacities in addition to
the philosophy of science are also needed for uh full humans full relationships and a vital
civilization and this is critical when we get into sense making and is it an intellectual
topic and specifically problem definitions and problem solving one way of looking at what the
generator function of the issues is of existential risk catastrophic risk is that the way we solve
problems almost exclusively causes additional problems usually worse ones
and it's because we define the problem in a narrow way the problem is getting SAT scores up
the problem is getting voter turnout the problem is getting CO2 down the problem whatever it is
right well can I do that and succeed while harming something else that I was outside of
what I'm measuring and paying attention to yeah all the time right the the problem is getting GDP
up because that's going to equal increase quality of life in GDP per capita whatever well can I
ruin the environment in the process can I use nitrogen fertilizers to plant uh CO2 sequestering
plants to take CO2 down in a way that drives dead zones in the ocean faster can I like so
so the question is what is the real problem it's actually beyond any scientific model I can ever
give because I can never say what is in the unknown unknown space of things that are connected
that I haven't paid attention to yet but if my vow is to anything smaller than that I will become a
paperclip maximizer under good intention right ultimately I've got to say okay well I'm my best
understanding is these the way these things are connected so we work on it but then we find that
but then we find that we're externalizing harm to some other critical part we have to change it what
is it that recognizes it's not the model of these 12 metrics matter these 17 goals there's something
that can recognize what else is meaningful that is connected it has to be able to keep changing the
thing right upgrading it and fundamentally we have to operate from there and so with that so we can
continue to scientifically make better models but the model is never actually reality and that's
kind of the key insight and there's a place to be able to have a connection to and a devotion to
reality and it says the model is useful but it's not real it's not it's not the reality it's just
useful and it'll also be problematic and we'll have to change it and taking the model as if it is
more than that is kind of false idol worship which ends up being the you know path to the dark
side to good intention thanks um i'm just looking at the questions on slider there's a lot of them
that are anonymous but uh there's an uploaded one luke am i right yeah i mean i think we should go
for the first one which is i mean we've we've brushed on it as through so many angles but perhaps
asking indirectly is still very interesting which is the question of governance and how we can get
both effective and legitimate governance in this world where the of which the mental complexity
is i said in the question for beyond the mental complexity of the average citizen
um yeah and perhaps um i mean i guess all these questions we could spend a really long time on
it but um your shortest answer possible um so that we can take as many of the the questions of people
who are here in how do we do governance in a situation where the infocomplexity is beyond
what can be synthesized in a single person is that the question yeah i think i think that's the
question yeah so obviously the question is where does the information complexity get synthesized
what is if not a person what is a capacity and this way a lot of people turn to ai the other
answers collect is ci collective intelligence so what is a capacity that can process the actual
complexity of it adequately to come up with appropriate choices a few things i would say
here one is even though information or just total data grows on a exponential curve what is really
necessary for us to contemplate and choice making it has to do with starting to make sense of that
data and get meaning out of it the kind of real situational intelligence to inform meaning is a
second or third derivative of that and you can involve machine learning to help process pre-process
chunks of that without needing it to be true agi that creates an interface layer between humans
being able to get stuff that is partially pre-processed but that then needs general intelligence
then the question is what are the collective intelligence processes between people and i and
it this would take a whole session to even start to unpack but i'll say a couple parts
the quote by Charles Kettering that a problem fully understood is half solved
and the corollary being that a problem not understood is actually unsolvable because
you don't even know what you're trying to solve properly there's a process of getting design
constraints that needs to be factored into any problem solving process where you have to say
do we understand the etiology of the problem and the problem embedding landscape meaning not just
this problem those sets of metrics but the other things it's connected to well enough
that our solution is addressing what caused the problem addressing the intrinsics of the problem
and not externalizing harm to adjacent things and so and you've got to separate there is a kind
of first second person part of that in the third person part which is what are the things we value
that we care about that can't be measured and then and maybe we can measure things a corollary
but it's ultimately a value and then what is the third person sense making about what is actually
happening and the forecasting of what would the effect of a particular action be and so there's
different epistemologies that you apply to kind of third person sense making to forecasting and to
second person values generation and so we have to take the partial sense making that lots of people
have and lots of groups have and be able to bed to verify fault you know falsify verify and then
synthesize it and then we have to also do values generation that way okay so you're mainly focused
on the environment you're mainly focused on the economy you're mainly focused on national
security why does that thing matter okay now let's separate your desire for national security from
your strategy because your strategy requires fucking the environment let's separate your
value on the environment from your strategy because it involves fucking the economy let's just say
we care about the environment what are the key things that have to be paid attention to here
we care about national security what are the key things maybe there's some assumptions that we can
get rid of maybe the strategies jump too quickly to a particular strategy because they weren't
looking at the rest of it but if we put all those values together and then say is there a
synergistic satisfactor or a better synergistic satisfactor that addresses all of those values
that's a really key part that is radically under addressed in most any kind of system of governance
and can that be decomposed so we can do it in parts but then recompose with thought on wholism
it can now it needs people that are oriented to incapable of doing that plus it also needs
systems that are capable of doing that and who's going to build the systems people that
understand it which is why it has to start with the people and so this is why starting with
some people right in a culture first is a starting point to a hopefully auto putting process
that is not a adequate answer but it was what seemed like something
we could definitely spend a session on it um actually i'm pretty excited also about the
next question and i think it might also get into uh it's more deeply and um i think it was asked by
eric eric do you feel like giving a bit more context on your question on whether the
confidence project is a modernist post-modernist or meta-modernist project and um yeah
yeah sure can people hear me you hear me okay great um uh this has been really interesting
thanks uh i realized that this frame in the frame of the question might not feel helpful but um
and you know maybe this is uh just made us on my mind this this framing because i'm we're doing a
session tomorrow on sort of meta-modernism so it's yeah sort of fresh on my mind uh but i thought
there were a lot of overlaps and resonances here between conciliants and the meta-modernist sort
of political framework um and i thought that the meta-modernist framework might actually offer some
some insight here but sort of side note to this which is that um it's often hard to choose which
frameworks to use especially because there are so many of them to sort of be vying for um as
Phoebe called i think the meta-theoretical framework uh status so um it seems like there
there's sort of a lot of meta-theoretical frameworks and almost like an a sort of meta-theoretical
framework industrial complex we have to deal with here you know when theorists make their
livelihood after often producing these sorts of things um you know you're running the problem
maybe that that conciliants is trying to solve which is like you can sunset a project we can't
sunset a theorist um and maybe we need to sunset theorists and i say that as a theorist you know
i don't mean that with any hostility um there's just so many concepts i guess that that uh we try
to relate anyway so the question of modernism post-modernism and meta-modernism uh i'm wondering
whether um in a sort of reductionist sense uh you know if we think of met modernism as or a
modernist project as being trying to sort of universalize a particular logic and its sort
of associated force in a post-modernist project maybe syncs seeks a sort of foundationless exchange
of forces and logic so many different things sort of existing side by side um a meta-modernist project
would seek to sort of reconcile diverse experiences within a unified whole and it feels like conciliants
is working on that i mean i feel like uh they know many other things you've been speaking about here
seem to relate to that idea um so i think you know someone like benjamin bratton maybe is doing
more of a modernist project trying to build sort of planetary governance and terraforming the whole
planet maybe pluriversal concepts or more post-modernist right trying to sort of uh create
you know human civilization this sort of ecosystem with harmonious ontologies and their
associated cultures living aside each other um but the conciliants project yeah it seems
quite meta-modern uh particularly this effort to reconcile diverse perspectives and experiences
into something coherent so i guess the the thought i had around sort of trans media and
sort of tracking down what you call the deeper generator functions beneath the world's major
problems um yeah just has has some real resonances here with with um hansi frinox idea of sort of
transpartisanism so this idea that one should seek to um sort of create an interchange between all
parties and truly listen to where those parties and perspectives are coming from so rather than
winning i think as you put it earlier you're trying to actually resolve tensions and i think this
relates maybe to some of the democratic questions that are in some of the other questions you know
someone like john dewey would say that you know democratic culture isn't just about voting in
fact that's the bare minimum what you really need is like a public that's invited to participate in
democracy and then that brings them into a culture of sort of democratic participation
and education and discussion and so forth um so i guess i guess one of the things that
metamonism seems to be doing that i haven't found the conciliants project um is this question of
like the individual and addressing the way that like the individual i think if we're to think about
democracy in a sort of complex way it's not just about individuals making choices it's about groups
of individuals sort of finding their collective interests and then voicing those through democratic
institutions and uh the metamonist project tries to sort of look at um this i have like this idea
of trans individualism so like not just thinking about the individual or the collective but kind of
like the shuttle between the individual and the collective and so i guess the question i'm trying
to ask really here is whether metamonism might help you to think about sort of group participation
in democracy and whether whether the the sort of basic unit that you're trying to address your
historical agent or whatever is the group rather than the individual thanks yeah yeah good increase
so the metamodern movements and thinking um and the integral movement and thinking are obviously both
relevant connected uh number of the people who are in the kind of core team of conciliants have been
contributors to metamodernism um friends with hansi and you know that kind of work um and integral in
their uh i would say that they definitely have some shared ideas and adjacencies and one way of
thinking about it is the thing that integral sometimes calls tier two in a very simple way a
relevant thing of talking about is operating intentionally at the level of synthesis kind
of in a simple hegelian dialectical sense is have we understood a thesis well have we understood
an antithesis well do we understand how they relate and is there a higher order uh perspective that
doesn't put them as dichotomous but holds them as being part of a kind of a higher order understanding
so individualism and collectivism need to live in a synthesis and so we can see failure modes of
societies in either direction advantage the individual in a way that leads to tragedy of the
commons type collective issues and and chaos issues or advantage the uh commons and collective in
ways that lead to too much imposition and lack of freedom etc on the individual and we can see
so many propositions for new social models that fail on either of those sides so instead we want
to say what is the relationship between the individual and collective bi-directionally
how do collectives condition and support individuals how are collectives created by the
emergent behavior of lots of individuals and how do we get a virtuous cycle between those
and so you know you'll see things like no we don't like welfare um and so we don't want ubi
anything welfare like because we want agentic individuals um we don't want ones that depend
on the system and create free rider issues and that kind of thing uh but then a particular
model of doing that that doesn't recognize that everybody doesn't get access to the same healthcare
and the same education or the or the same type of developmental environments and so um a lot of
people are left in utterly fucked situations that then ends up damaging the society as a whole
most of the answers fail in one of the two directions but if you instead say okay well how
do we do how do we do support individuals in a way that increases their sovereignty and agency
rather than increases their dependence how do we support the kind of increasing uh individuality
and citizenry capacity of people so that you have collectives or yeah we'll say collectives that are
conditioning healthier and more autonomous and free thinking individuals who are also oriented
to contribute back to a better collective and you get a virtuous cycle of both up regulating
that's the kind of thing that I would say any cultural enlightenment has to get
some version of that and in Indian cultural enlightenment to Chinese cultural enlightenment
and Islamic cultural enlightenment that would draw on some of the unique history and worldview
and heritage they they would all still need to get that thing right they would all need to get
the synthesis of rights and responsibilities which relate to individual and collective all of those
deep kind of polarities um and metamodernism is basically I mean one way of describing it is
post post modernism if modernity was an answer to the question of like we can see that modernity
gave rise to modern democracies and open society which is if the scientific method allows us to
all come to the same conclusion on things there's an inherently unifying element of it
and if that combined with a Hegelian dialectic of being able to take each other's viewpoint
and then seek a synthesis and those were both key aspects of modernity right
then we don't have to have some few people impose government on everyone because the people can
come to shared sense making and have shared choice making that's effective because it was
clear you couldn't there are cultural antecedents to democracy you can't do shared choice making on
people that have no basis of reconciling what they value or their views of the world and so
modernity was a you know a reconciliation basis post modernism identified good real critiques of
both epistemic failures in modernity and ethical failures in the results of it in the institutions
they created but if it stays at deconstruction you don't yet have a new way of coordinating
effectively and if we say there is no way to come to understand truth then all there is is power
and now we're definitely extinct because then that's actually reifying the basis of the multi
polar traps in the game theory and so we have to say no there is actually a basis for choice
making beyond power and it it is our ability to take partial epistemologies and synthesize them
and it does take good it it does take certain kinds of values and good faith effort to be able
to do that so I would say align with metamodernism in that way and then the where there are distinctions
are healthy details healthy details to be able to you know have conversations that are running
different versions of it awesome thank you and it's a very interesting exchange okay the next
question is perhaps shorter to answer this strength of the movement depends on its alliances
I think quoting the the continuance project website who are your allies
well who are allies right now and who they will be obviously we hope is different to
hopefully some of the people on this call and groups that they know of what become allies
and the allies all so actually I want to step back I would say that there is a implicit unofficial
official alliance with everyone that is working towards anything that would fit within the
existential hope umbrella including and even if they aren't framing it that big if they're working
towards a healthier fourth estate healthier education healthier governance healthier economics
healthier social systems there's a there's a sense that we identify as allies with what
they're trying to do and would want to support it in terms of people that we're actively collaborating
with we're actively collaborating with the Center for Humane Technology and Tristan and that crew
we're actively collaborating with the the Helena group who maybe this group knows less they're kind
of they kind of founded with a idea of the idea of liberal democracy is that any good solution
should get implemented by the market or the government but there are some good solutions
that aren't being implemented why is that there's some failures in government or market they're
not trying to solve the how to make markets and governments better they're trying to be a shim
of how do we get the good solutions catalyzed to a place that either government or market will
take them over afterwards where some catalytic potential is needed and so we're working on a
number of projects with them we have some allies that are in the intelligence space which is
important for the situational assessments and the kind of sense making ergo and bismarck and
ones like that uh yeah so it could go on but uh more allies will be listed on the site soon
maybe is there anyone who was forgotten in the allies or that you feel you want to mention
um i i don't think so i think there's i think the the potential and the exciting part is probably
the potential allies um and and we haven't really gone very much into um politics here and the kind
of left and right and and the fact that i mean in in my eyes and what really originally drew me
to the project was this idea of kind of different political persuasions and ideologies uniting behind
you know epistemic justice and sense making and i think there are a lot of really interesting
organizations doing work in that space who will be excellent um allies
yeah we've had the fortune of talking to uh people in the new biden administration
and people in dc who've been in congress rescinded for a long time and who even if they have been
actually the um the people waging partisan warfare uh historically are more concerned
about it than they have been in terms of recognizing i guess very interesting how many people in dc
i've spoke with in very senior positions who are afraid of the end or irrelevance of the us
in a way that they weren't even a few years ago and as a result or think thinking and willing
to think more deeply about it seems like we need some approach that is different than who wins every
four years or you know two or six years uh and that they can see issues like social media has
affected democracy in super fundamental ways where everybody doesn't read the same newspaper
and how do we possibly deal with the fact that people have personalized news feeds that optimize
for bias and limbic hijack like uh and recognizing more of them that you can't do mutually assured
destruction in a very multipolar catastrophic world there's an increased awareness that the
way they've been trying to do things fails and they have kids you know and they're and they
think about that so even if they've been apex predator game theory orientation they're like
fuck kids and people in wall street in a similar position and so i've been seeing an increased
interest in more fundamental and deeper answers as the as when covet hit in particular covet
was the beginning of there were prescient people talking about catastrophic risk but it became a
lived experience for everybody and most people know that covet was a pretty not bad catastrophic
risk compared to lots of the ones that are decently probable and we got to see how not
prepared we were even though we should have been prepared that people as credible as gates were
talking about it forever and we weren't prepared and how bad our even if we weren't prepared how
bad our responsive capacity was and how many adjacent things got damaged right like
the amount of food supply in india that got damaged by the supply chains being shut down from the
closures of travel and in the middle east and in africa the rise of boko haram in nigeria and food
insecurity for 26 million people there are so many issues that happen because this is again the way
we define the problem is the problem we define the problem as covet transmission and created
solutions that caused worse problems because of the complexity of a radically interconnected
global supply chain that doesn't have enough stocks to be able to deal with the flows when
there's interruption and efficiency and anti fragility are usually inversely proportional in
a system and so a system that optimized for heavy efficiency gets a big enough blip and the fragility
starts to show up covet then george floyd riots and the radical partisan conflict between the
trump and establishment kind of perspectives uh and the increased awareness of how social
media is done contributed to that has definitely made people in top positions of institutional
power thinking differently than i have seen them in my life before two years ago
which is promising
um yeah it's very interesting okay great um well i'll take one last question from the
chat i think maybe in we can do it in five minutes um what um so is the question from wealth wealth
maybe you want to just ask it directly sure thank you hey phoebe hey daniel this was great i'm super
excited um i think the question was something around the lines of what was it
right what attractors do you see for inversing the dynamics of limit capitalism
and the attention economy in particular um and kind of in that direction if we turn the
kind of persuasive tech optimizing for attention extraction around what does that look like and
how how does it not become this paper clip maximizer uh that we don't want
do you want to speak to that phoebe
i wealth could you could you repeat the question because i i don't know if i fully
yeah grasp what you're saying so right now we have kind of the attention economy
isolates kind of stage of evolution of limit capitalism which is like optimizing for how
do we get to the bottom of the brainstem how do we get people to make choices that are
less than omnipositive because diction is a great business model so how do we turn that around
what attractors do you see um that could be something like a meta modern revival of the
human potential movement in a way that doesn't suck and that isn't cringe and that's kind of
very deeply connected with epistemic um kind of inquiry but then also turns into
um yeah just just embodied an enacted choice making mediated through technology
mediated through technology hmm um well i wonder if that's possible firstly through
technology it might be that it's not it might be that that's not how humans really regain their full
uh sovereignty and epistemics um yeah i mean the the question without the
bi-technology part is definitely is the question that i've uh i'm i'm very curious about and i
don't have an answer for but i i sense that it's it's i mean the question is sort of
answered by this whole all of this stuff that uh Daniel and i are um currently in inquiry around
um i think it's about engaging a different part of the mind and the and the being i mean the the
technology the the approaches you're talking about sort of hijack limbic processes and and target
and use your addictions and you know use algorithms to kind of exacerbate uh addiction to
yeah material online um and so i guess the question is what is the opposite of that and
a lot of Daniel you you could speak to you know the the sorts of methodologies that i guess your
team has been prototyping and working with uh this kind of epistemic immunity and um teaching
people about how these algorithms do what they do helping build an awareness helping build an immunity
um yeah uh it's it's almost midnight here in London so i i think my brain is like not not
it's sharpest but that's that's a i have a lot of thoughts on that i think it could be like a full
a full webinar but i yeah i'm aware of the time as well that we've got a minute to go
uh i would add some things to that do we have a hard stuff at a minute
nope go ahead i mean people are always welcome to drop off if they need to
add but please please uh go on so you know it's a hard question you're asking and um you know
Tristan and i have had a couple dozen conversations on parts of that and as much as he's in the
center of it it's he's like pulling his hair out on how hard a question that is all the time
i'll address a few parts
so when you're talking about the limbic economy you're talking about a the relationship between
hypernormal stimuli and supply side economics and that if the fundamental idea that made market
theory a type of collective intelligence is that demand drives supply that people want
things that will actually improve the quality of their life and uh that they will look at the
various options that are available and choose the best product or service at the best price
i'm talking old pre behavioral econ homo economicus right and that's true that type of market with a
symmetry of information rational choice making and demand driving supply is a kind of decentralized
bottom up collective intelligence system um and then the fact that humans don't make rational
choices of course starts to break it but the thing that really starts to break it is when supply
becomes so much larger than demand and its coordination capacity of course there's a
symmetry between supply and demand meaning within an industry the total amount of dollars
flowing from demand and to supply are going to be the same but you don't have a union of all
google customers that is working together to coordinate its game theoretic interests against
google but you do have google coordinating to but if google's coordinating with me so it's me
against the you know most of a trillion dollar business and so the degree and they're employing
ai and biometrics and whatever the fuck else that is being employed so it's a radically asymmetric
situation and then supply recognizes that it can drive demand it can manufacture demand
and so as soon as we start getting supply side driven manufactured demand the
under fundamental theory of market starts to break down the intelligence of it as the system
starts to break down and then the best way to drive demand is through limbic hijacks through the
most susceptible parts of people so then every MBA learns at the very beginning optimize lifetime
value of a customer multiplied by total addressable market is the value of your business model
so how do we get everybody to want the thing and to want lots of it and addiction is a very good
way of doing that and once I can customize my addiction drip to each person based on their
interaction in a way that mcdonald's couldn't quite do and the news couldn't quite do and I can
engage every aspect of their limbic susceptibility their social creatures they're lonely they want
to see other social creatures what are the kinds of people they most want to see who are the kinds
of people that frighten them the most with make their newsfeed a good ai optimized thing based
on time on site because the business model is doing time on site optimization as a basis for ad
revenue so we know the ad revenue thing has to go right there's a few things that have to go that
business model fundamentally has to go because you can't have ai doing time on site optimization
now how does that go there's bottom ups ways of of course some people who care about that enough
exiting and building a new thing and then realizing that more health and effectiveness
is created there and it becomes a stranger tractor there's top down things like being able to use
antitrust law and being able to use fiduciary contract law and various things like that to try
to change the nature of how those platforms operate both are hard both should be pursued
um so one a couple things i'll say about hypernormal stimuli in general and kind of supply
side stuff we are more susceptible to hypernormal stimuli when we're in a hyponormal environment
to our actual evolutionary basis this is a really key insight which is when most people go camping
with their friends they aren't checking their cell phone when they're around the campfire talking
and playing music with each other and they usually if they're going to a festival or whatever
and they're more meaningfully engaged in the type of environments that have creativity and real
connection and the the the underlying basis of our kind of tribal evolutionary history and whatever
happening less susceptible to checking the phone less susceptible to addiction of all kinds so
so we focus on the hypernormal stimuli part but we should focus on the hyponormal environment
that creates maximum susceptibility to that which is we shouldn't be living alone and with such poor
relational interconnectivity virtual relationships do not replace real physical relationships
etc so how do you so one thing is how do we create environments that are filled with
healthy stimuli right the right kinds of stimuli so that there is not this gaping wound of i need
a dopamine hit from fucking something that creates hypernormal stimuli maximization well that looks
like community building right physical intentional community building also actual communities of
activity and engagement and practice and and does community building start to actually change we can
say that the post-industrial world created so much hyponormal basis that the hyponormal stimuli
grew in that environmental niche and so we have to actually remove the environmental niche for the
success of that that's one really critical part that doesn't get enough focus another critical
part is in the valley you repeat that what's that can you just repeat the last
about the the the hyponormal environment not getting enough attention how that needs to
be turned around yeah the if you think about it from niche theory if you have an environmental
niche that has some energy and it will get exploited so if you want a certain kind of thing not to
happen you have to actually close the niche for it like one of the core things we have to think about
is why is humans behaving sociopathically so fucking rewarding like why do why do they economically
do so well what is the niche that we've created because in tribes that wasn't the case if you
lied and fucked your neighbor over in a tribe you got kicked out of the tribe because the small
scale forced transparency and you couldn't hide the accounting so there's a place of being able to
hide it get away with it game the incentive system of it that creates a niche for sociopathic
favor and then you get niche creation type processes the same is true for hyponormal stimuli
so hyponormal stimuli people are radically sensitive to in hyponormal environments so we
actually have to remove the hyponormal environments by providing the real meaningful things that are
the basis of a meaningful human life which involve connection to nature connection to other people
and connection to right vocation and those types of things so that's a huge aspect that doesn't
get talked about enough the next key part has to do with hormesis and ontologic design
we started writing a paper and it'll have to get a new title because I think right now it's called
something like ontologic design in the Anthropocene emphasizing hormesis but the idea there is
in a world where we mostly live in environments we did not evolve to be fit to we live in built
environments that are not the ones that we evolve for we didn't evolve in terms of the social
environment or the actual physical built environment and then we engage in digital environments
of the same type so in the digital and Anthropocene age the ontologic design is we
make the environments and then the environments are in turn conditioning us because we're plastic
right so what type of environments do we want to create that would condition the types of people
so fundamentally we get back to what is a meaningful human life what is a meaningful
civilization how do those relate and then what kinds of environments do we create that are having
that influence because you can't say well but we don't want to condition people you can't not
condition people so since conditioning is inexorable you have to say all right well how
do we take responsibility for the fact that that's the case and one of the key principles in
evolutionary theory is that the strength or resilience of the system is always a result
of the hormetic pressures on it right meaning it's it a muscle has to be stressed to get bigger
any adaptive capacity is in is in relationship to a need to be able to adapt to different kinds of
stressors and so if I live in a temperature controlled environment where I'm never exposed
to hot and cold my metabolic flexibility will actually go down because my metabolic flexibility
was there to respond to extremes of or you know wider ranges of temperature if I don't ever exercise
my muscles though atrophy so if I don't go to the edge of my cognitive abilities if I don't go to
the edge of my volitional capabilities I won't grow them and so we grow stronger and people
through hormesis but we've had a society that has optimized for comfort and for speed and for
convenience which basically conditions omni-shitty people right like conditions people that are
maximally not resilient and then also maximally susceptible to more other hypernormal stimuli
so there's a way that every source of hypernormal stimuli is actually in a conspiracy with all
the other ones they're not actually conspiring they just have a shared incentive landscape
um and they and they have a shared niche which is humans that are not very self-directed
and so the the facebook thing will make the mcdonalds thing more likely and then the
porn thing more likely and then the you know on and on and so
we all we all know this thing where it's like the people that we respect the most usually had
super hard lives usually they had some super hard experiences that forged them and you look
at victor frankle nelson mendela whatever right you're like fuck they were they were forged in
something but we also know that most of the really fucked up people had really hard lives and they
were traumatized and you're like okay is there a way we can how do we get one of those without
getting the other how do we get the benefits of the strength and resilience of people that can
overcome environmental difficulties without traumatizing them and making damaged people
i would argue that every wisdom society did that through rituals
through rites of passage and rituals that a this is not the only thing i don't want to
reduce it but that a huge part of what the sweat lodge and what the sundance and what the vision
quest and what the ayahuasca journey and what the yoga asana was about was something that's
actually difficult and uncomfortable that we do not only regularly but together where i get the
strength of overcoming the difficulties and we get the strength of doing that together without trauma
and then the sweat lodge the the key is that it's not hot enough it's really gonna hurt you but it's
hot enough that you think it's going to and you think you're gonna freak the fuck out for like
you start to freak out if you buy it but then you're like okay nobody's actually gonna get hurt
nobody ever has let me calm my mind and and i'm not gonna bail on all these other people they're
staying in here right well who would i be in the tribe if i bailed on everybody and so how
do i actually get some strength over the fear in my mind and now that person is more trustworthy
as a person i mean when i first started doing sweat lodges on one of the reservations the shaman
told me when when this guy bailed on his first time in he said i'll never trust somebody who
bails because they let everybody else stay in here if they really thought it was dangerous
they wouldn't do that and if they didn't really think it was dangerous it means they have no
control over themselves and either way i can't trust them and you got to see the tribal intelligence
that they had right which is we do this thing together and then we also celebrate together
the barn raising is not only do a difficult thing together but be involved in creation together
so if you maximize for convenience all the time how do you have people that have patience and
presence and fortitude if you maximize for ease so you can't but that doesn't mean we don't like
that we need to ride wagons everywhere or go back to horses everywhere like it's nice to have hyper loops
so and and fast computers it means you have to ritually insert difficulty of the right type
that conditions the right qualities in the people and where there is but why would anyone
fucking do that if there isn't a virtue or a value system around that that is actually at the heart
of culture and so the question of how do you make people that are less susceptible to hyponormal
stimuli so get rid of the hyponormal environment and condition strength and resilience in people
those are both critical aspects in addition to how do we deal with the tech stuff to deal with the
tech stuff of course we have to change the business model of course we have to create a fiduciary
contract relationship that if they have privileged information about people they can't use that in
the game theoretic relationship against them they have to get the principal agent thing right there's
a bunch of things we have to get there which basically says if we change the incentive how
could the how could social exponential tech be good what would a vision for it that was good
and you have to obviously have to change the incentive to do that there's a lot more we can
say but those are a few thoughts fascinating thoughts thank you well for the question and
Daniel for the like detailed answer I guess it's time to close this session thank you for the
all the of you who are in latest time zones and maybe tired and maybe thank you for sticking
all the way and I guess I just wanted to ask to close this session if you two have any call to
action or maybe you know want to answer the question quickly of like what is the thing
you most critically need right now and that maybe this group could provide and yeah maybe you can
leave us with that Daniel do you want to go first so first I'll just say thank you for everybody
being here for interest and I am grateful to share that I'm very much interested to hear
people's you know thoughts interests concerns critiques I see that people sent private messages
here and I didn't see them because I was trying to pay attention and then this thing's going to
close and I won't see him so if you feel like there is a collaboration opportunity and you
want to be engaged in some way either message me on Facebook because means it will see who we know
in common or mess or Daniel at civilizationresearch.org what do we need for the conciliants project one
very obvious thing is it's a nonprofit we're seeking funding if you know groups it would be
interested in funding that's obviously a critical thing so we can grow team in addition to that
people who understand these issues understand some of the issues well enough and could actually
contribute as researchers writers or who have design skills legal skills
animation skills other things that are relevant to the overall project operational skills and
that are very mission-aligned obviously very interested in that also if you have adjacent
projects and there is some way there could be collaboration though you'll unfortunately I'll
respond to those much slower than I wish because we don't have the internal bandwidth to engage
the collaborative opportunities as fully as we would like so there's a step function there
and of course if you're just interested in reading the stuff and kind of being apprised like
that's great that's and then if because you are probably doing your own projects and if
what we're sharing can be in some way enriching to the projects you're doing that's already
collaboration Lou thank you for having me and Phoebe I'm really looking forward to your
moral imaginations conversation and thank you for being in the dialogue with me here
yeah I've really I've enjoyed it and I look forward to more because I feel like we've just
scratched the surface of the kind of intellectual discussion about what why and how and how to have
most impact and kind of theory of a change which I'm very very keen to continue and yeah as advisor
to the project like I just I encourage you to yeah get in touch with Daniel and yeah if people
would like like I'm very interested in discussing the project as well with anybody who's interested
in kind of unpicking different parts or brainstorming about different ways that it could have impact so
very much there for that as well and and then yeah like I'm excited what we'll be hosting
more events with Lou as part of my foresight fellowship around capacity building citizen
sense making and the different methodologies and approaches of doing that from the kind of
rational to the more creative and perhaps intangible so I think it's 4th of May is the
is when we've got a session so we'd love to see people there yeah that's it may 4th somebody's
put in the chat great thank you thank you so much for having me um yes thank you for being Daniel
I'm really really really grateful this was a wonderful and deep conversation um will I can
you can send me also if you want me to share anything uh with participants I'm really happy
to relay to the group I will also be sharing in a follow-up email um the invite to the session
with PB on moral imaginations which is on May 4th as well as this weekend we have um existential
writing workshop which is an opportunity to create to co-create little fictions that will
be pieces of existential hope and like positive visions of the future that that we want to aim for
that's going to be this Saturday anyway I'll I'll send all these things in the chat because this
was already a lot of information um yeah thank you everyone for joining thank you for the fantastic
questions I'm never disappointed by the quality of the engagement in this community and it really
warms my heart to see like so many people really care and and really get into it so thank you everyone
infinitely
