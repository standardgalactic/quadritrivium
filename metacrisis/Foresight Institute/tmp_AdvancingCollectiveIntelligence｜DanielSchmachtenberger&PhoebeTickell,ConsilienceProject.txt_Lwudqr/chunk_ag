of culture and so the question of how do you make people that are less susceptible to hyponormal
stimuli so get rid of the hyponormal environment and condition strength and resilience in people
those are both critical aspects in addition to how do we deal with the tech stuff to deal with the
tech stuff of course we have to change the business model of course we have to create a fiduciary
contract relationship that if they have privileged information about people they can't use that in
the game theoretic relationship against them they have to get the principal agent thing right there's
a bunch of things we have to get there which basically says if we change the incentive how
could the how could social exponential tech be good what would a vision for it that was good
and you have to obviously have to change the incentive to do that there's a lot more we can
say but those are a few thoughts fascinating thoughts thank you well for the question and
Daniel for the like detailed answer I guess it's time to close this session thank you for the
all the of you who are in latest time zones and maybe tired and maybe thank you for sticking
all the way and I guess I just wanted to ask to close this session if you two have any call to
action or maybe you know want to answer the question quickly of like what is the thing
you most critically need right now and that maybe this group could provide and yeah maybe you can
leave us with that Daniel do you want to go first so first I'll just say thank you for everybody
being here for interest and I am grateful to share that I'm very much interested to hear
people's you know thoughts interests concerns critiques I see that people sent private messages
here and I didn't see them because I was trying to pay attention and then this thing's going to
close and I won't see him so if you feel like there is a collaboration opportunity and you
want to be engaged in some way either message me on Facebook because means it will see who we know
in common or mess or Daniel at civilizationresearch.org what do we need for the conciliants project one
very obvious thing is it's a nonprofit we're seeking funding if you know groups it would be
interested in funding that's obviously a critical thing so we can grow team in addition to that
people who understand these issues understand some of the issues well enough and could actually
contribute as researchers writers or who have design skills legal skills
animation skills other things that are relevant to the overall project operational skills and
that are very mission-aligned obviously very interested in that also if you have adjacent
projects and there is some way there could be collaboration though you'll unfortunately I'll
respond to those much slower than I wish because we don't have the internal bandwidth to engage
the collaborative opportunities as fully as we would like so there's a step function there
and of course if you're just interested in reading the stuff and kind of being apprised like
that's great that's and then if because you are probably doing your own projects and if
what we're sharing can be in some way enriching to the projects you're doing that's already
collaboration Lou thank you for having me and Phoebe I'm really looking forward to your
moral imaginations conversation and thank you for being in the dialogue with me here
yeah I've really I've enjoyed it and I look forward to more because I feel like we've just
scratched the surface of the kind of intellectual discussion about what why and how and how to have
most impact and kind of theory of a change which I'm very very keen to continue and yeah as advisor
to the project like I just I encourage you to yeah get in touch with Daniel and yeah if people
would like like I'm very interested in discussing the project as well with anybody who's interested
in kind of unpicking different parts or brainstorming about different ways that it could have impact so
very much there for that as well and and then yeah like I'm excited what we'll be hosting
more events with Lou as part of my foresight fellowship around capacity building citizen
sense making and the different methodologies and approaches of doing that from the kind of
rational to the more creative and perhaps intangible so I think it's 4th of May is the
is when we've got a session so we'd love to see people there yeah that's it may 4th somebody's
put in the chat great thank you thank you so much for having me um yes thank you for being Daniel
I'm really really really grateful this was a wonderful and deep conversation um will I can
you can send me also if you want me to share anything uh with participants I'm really happy
to relay to the group I will also be sharing in a follow-up email um the invite to the session
with PB on moral imaginations which is on May 4th as well as this weekend we have um existential
writing workshop which is an opportunity to create to co-create little fictions that will
be pieces of existential hope and like positive visions of the future that that we want to aim for
that's going to be this Saturday anyway I'll I'll send all these things in the chat because this
was already a lot of information um yeah thank you everyone for joining thank you for the fantastic
