there's about a half a dozen or so initial articles on there and a half a dozen more will
be up here shortly but I'll go ahead and describe so publishing and movement building
first I'll say something about the project it's a non-profit uh it's committed to be a pure
non-profit so no revenue streams it will never sell any of the information or hide it behind a
paywall it'll never sell anybody's data for marketing purposes it'll never put an ad on the
site because all of those um would corrupt the information ecology in some ways and we're trying
to help the information ecology and the epistemic commons actually like stewarding those needs to
have no dual master's issues no other thing we're optimizing for so we're also not measuring our
success in terms of number of clicks or number of shares or anything like that because basically
any of those metric sets you would optimize for become paperclip maximizers in some way
so
and then the project ends in five years so five years from a week ago and
uh we intentionally sunset it because it makes it very clear that it's not seeking a position
in the long-term power landscape it doesn't want to be a major media player or directing government
or anything like that so it's not an interesting place to come for power seeking ladder climbers
and anyone who wants to do good work in any adjacent space knows we aren't a competitor
because we don't achieve any of our long-term goals if we don't get lots of other groups
to succeed so when we do our public postmortem in five years at the end of the project
where we succeeded and where we failed a huge amount of our success will be what things we
help catalyze that in or facilitate that are continuing afterwards including lots of other
projects that's the movement building side just a general principle everybody in here should think
about it's not always the right idea to sunset a project but it's certainly a good idea to think
about because um a project's ongoing existence if it's trying to solve a problem can be a
perverse incentive and this happens all the time and this is most of the NGO space if I have a
project emerge to solve a problem if I really solve the problem I go out of business but let's say
I'm the world food programmer I'm some now a large organization where the individuals who make the
choices in the organization because the organization doesn't make choices people do the people have a
lot of fucking power being at the top of it they're incentivized to manage the problem forever
not to really solve it not to lead themselves so the pathological orientation of a system to
keep being itself if it emerged to solve a problem is something you have to factor into the design
up front uh and so does it end at a certain amount of time is there some path to the convergence
towards the solution and then it ends or transitions is there some governance process to
pay attention to that okay so I'll say briefly what the publishing arm is seeking to do with
the movement building arm and then we'll um see thoughts and questions publishing arm there are
three types of basically long form articles we're writing right now and then those long form articles
will be translated into being discussed on podcasts and we're working on making animation
versions so high school students can access them because the because the articles are kind of long
and kind of in depth so they're not something that we think everybody's going to read right now
this gets to Phoebe's question of elite versus everybody the goal is everybody but in steps
there is not one thing you can share that will appeal to the most ardent Trump supporter and
the most ardent Antifa supporter at the same time very well and yet we obviously have to fix that
issue if we're going to have a democracy and be able to coordinate well enough to do anything
and this you know we've talked about this issue before but you know China has already implemented
high-speed trains all around the world and the US hasn't built one yet and we're like what the
fuck why like that's just a one example we could talk about it with regard to building transistors
and and lithography or supply chains or lots of things but it's like why can't we build a high
speed train and why and it has to do with institutional decay and specifically in a democracy
in an autocracy as we can see in China you can get rid of the problem of internal infighting
and just have everybody kind of do the same thing or you can get rid of a lot of it through
imposition of top-down control you can also do long-term planning if you have one person
in rule for a very long time and in the US you're going to have a situation or anywhere where you
have term limits and we know why we have term limits somebody will work on something for four
years the next person will come in and undo that for four years and most of the energy is actually
spent on raising money for campaigning and so it's like you can't do long-term planning in that
situation and almost nobody invests in something that has more than a four-year return horizon
because it won't get them reelected so this is a big deal to say either technologically
empowered autocracy runs the 21st century and that we would argue has its own in fail cases
or we have to be able to have something like an open society coordinate better than autocracy can
coordinate this is now a design constraint of the future how the fuck do we get an open society to
coordinate better how do we get a lot of people to not be stuck in infighting and the way we think
of this is civilizations are a way of coordinating lots of human behavior and people who want different
things and view the world in different ways so they're predisposed to act in different ways
but that are consequential on each other and societies fail either through excessive oppression
or excessive chaos right the oppression chaos kind of thing and what they're seeking is order
and the order is either imposed in which case it moves in the direction of oppression
or if it's not imposed usually you don't get it you get increasing chaos and so we can see in the
US there's almost nothing that everybody even agrees on this fact about COVID hydroxychloroquine
viral origins climate change the reality of systemic racism anything like the base understanding
of fact the base understanding of values almost completely fractured so inability to coordinate
so if you want to have order that is not imposed it has to be emergent how do you get an emergent
order now this is why we get to culture emergent order is does everyone have the capacity to make
sense of the world in a similar way do they have the capacity training orientation interests to seek
to understand how other people are making sense of the world do they have the ability to share what
their values are seek to understand what other people's values are and find then synthesis of
what are all the values to then try to find design solutions that meet all of the values
simultaneously this those capacities which is collective sense making collective meaning
making are what allow collective choice making in an emergent way to create order as opposed to
imposition that is fundamentally a culture process
so coming back there was a long train from publishing so the articles that are the basis of
it are three types of articles there's basically theoretical pieces the foundation series we call
their situational assessments and there's meta-news the theory pieces are things like
what we're talking about here today what is the fundamental role of education to a civilization
what is education really supposed to do it has to do with the intergenerational knowledge transfer
and the generator function of knowledge for the auto-poesis of the civilization and etc so how
do we explain what the fundamental role is how do we explain how the major step functions in
education corresponding to the step functions and the techno-industrial base have have happened
in the past how do we explain the current breakdown of it and what the future of it needs to look like
same thing with general informantness fourth estate same thing with why we can't do nuclear
disarmament and why we can't stop a arms races what is the game theory of multi-polar traps
what would it take to solve them so the theory pieces are framing up and framing up things like
why are we sucking so much and solving climate change well it's because you can't
every solution for climate change has half the world oppose it because it externalizes harm to
some other things that they care about because the problem it's a carbon tax is the solution but
only some countries are going to ratify it and so let's say China doesn't and the US and Europe
does and it damages the GDP of the western nations relative to the other ones win a massive geopolitical
uh grab for powers already there and that increased GDP will be invested in near term control geopolitical
geopolitical military dominance and of course bunch of people will be like no fuck that that's a
bad solution and then they'll say I don't believe in climate change because they don't like the solution
that was proposed and then you say okay well what if we could get China to ratify it well then does
it hurt global GDP in a way that disproportionately hurts the poorest billion in which case they'll
be posing it because the commodity of price of food just went up or increases war because now we
don't have positive some dynamics or so you can't the problem is in climate change the problem is
the relationship between climate change geopolitical power markets energy return on energy investment
of the change of energy infrastructure right you have to think of those things together because
if you try to solve one in a way that's going to externalize harm somewhere else either you
succeed and it's not even worth doing or you don't succeed because half the world is paying
attention to the other thing resists you and all the energy is just wasted as heat um in infighting
so where people think they understand the problems currently they don't they understand a bunch of
separate parts which is why we can't succeed at anything those aren't the problems the problems
are how do they interconnect what are their common generators how do we solve that how do we do more
integrated design solution that's what allows us to get past infighting come up with solutions that
everybody can get on board with so the theory pieces are specking out this space what is the
current novel problem space of the world and what are the types of solutions need to look like what
is the the previous institutions we've had what is where do those break down and what is the future
of those institutions have to look like that's what those are and instead of doing that as a book
or a few big books it's done as a series of articles where each article is long enough deep
enough that someone can understand a principle or a topic deeply enough that they could be part
of the design solution they could be thinking about it but they can also do it in one sitting and
then it's interconnected with the other articles each one will hyperlink to the ones that are
connected to it so there's this interconnected media object that someone can start with education
or start with governance or start with economics or start with x-risk or whatever and then be able
to come into the adjacent spaces the situational assessments are where we're showing the current
issues in the world that we need to understand so describing the great power games that are at play
or describing why anything from the India China border conflict and what it's really about and
what it portends to the emergence of crypto and decentralized finance and what that portends for
traditional finance all those types of situational assessments but where the situation assessment
what we're doing that's novel compared to say foreign affairs or the diplomat or the economist
is we're applying the social theory we're looking at it in terms of multipolar traps or in terms of
coordination failures or the underlying game theory that's involved so people are able to
understand the issues in a different way that also make the theory ground itself in the current
world situation and it would give people some insight into what it would take to change that situation
and then where the situation that we're addressing is fraught meaning that there's a highly polarized
views on it then we do a meta-news thing that describes the media forensics of how those views
came about so like let's say we're talking about climate change and there's radically
divergent views on how bad the problem is if it's real what to do about it etc the or systemic racism
and we can see that people engage in statistical warfare where they all cherry pick their statistics
to make their case well and narrative warfare where they frame the conversation to make their case
so we want to do is be able to say okay well what are the various narratives about this sometimes
it's just a left and right but obviously sometimes the antifa far left and the establishment left
are totally different narratives and similarly cross space so we identify what are the narratives
that are currently trending how do we still manage narrative how do we
argue its case for it as best as it can and identify then what is authentic signal or truth
or real value in it both the values and the sense making then is there anything that is clearly
falsifiable or omitted or missing or framed let's identify that then let's be able to do that across
all of the narratives and then say what can we say synthesizing about the space as a whole
and also show where the way that social media algorithms have have driven that tribalism or
the way that very specific economic actors started paying for media or science of a particular type
or acts of kind of framing that create propaganda narrative or so in reading that the
one of the things that happens is people start to get the aspect of media literacy that they get a
memetic immune system they see that the thing that's being called news and even a lot of what's
being called communication of science is actually narrative and info war for specific economic or
political agendas and they start to recognize the tools of that like cherry picking of data
or decontextualization of a fact which will still make it through a fact checker or lay
cough framing the fact all that will make it through a fact checker and you can still lie
with that stuff so they'll be able to start to recognize that and recognize that they're victims
of a narrative war camp more than they are sovereign thinkers and so the goal is that they
can recognize it and have an immune system against it a memetic you know epistemic immune system
and then also develop the epistemic tools needed to actually make sense of complex topics
uh and the hope is once someone has done that for a few things and they realize that the camp
that they're a part of does say some true things but also they can see where the errors and omissions
or actual narrative war occurred the camp that they thought were total idiots is actually saying
some true and important things they can see that it's not good guy bad guy it's across the whole
space there are there's a competition that creates distortions based on partial truths
or based on partial value sets when they can start to see that and get out of it
then we start to create a new third poll outside of the polarity of people that can operate at the
level of synthesis rather than thesis anti-ceases and that becomes the strange attractor of culture
so those pieces together will all inter-reference each other the meta-news the theory of the
situational assessments and collectively we call that the conciliance papers and the conciliance
papers kind of like you know what the federalist papers were to the constitution a frame of the
issues and a frame of the theory that says this is the type of governance this is a frame for the
world to be thinking about what are the types of solutions moving forward that make sense that
address the the issues that are framed up here to make that more accessible each piece will go on
a podcast and have many different people who are involved dialoguing about different experts and
thinkers in the space will become a simpler article in animation so then you get a trans
media object of all those methods of communication all of this is you know open commons copyright
anybody can use it modify it advance it and the goal is not that we do all the work the goal is
is that other people get inspired to do similar work to disagree it's at whatever great disagree
we go to the points now the conversation about these topics is becoming center of culture
publishing side movement building side is maybe there's a group that is trying to fix journalism
already by addressing perverse incentives and journalism maybe there's a group that's trying
to fix education and improve civics and education maybe there's a group that is working on
supporting parenting to be doing early childhood development well or a group that is working on
solving social media algorithm bias issues we would say those are all actually working on this
cultural enlightenment they're working on facets they might not be framing it that way so we want
to be able to identify the ones that are actually well informed have good strategy and signal boost
them and then reframe those as parts of a shared cultural movement and be able to help more
attention capital resources flow to those projects and be able to help them be seen as
so when the movement starts to become self-aware it is a it's able to start creating better
relationships and knowledge sharing and catalysis and like that that's roughly the
the two branches names the project awesome well thank you so much for the great explanation
and all the context it's very nice to get you know deeper a deeper
development on why this is important I've read obviously a lot on the continence project to
prepare but that there is very useful okay so I have a lot of thoughts and questions but I really
want to hear Phoebe's on what has been just said and also on how as alexanderos asked in the chat
how moral imaginations ties into what has just been described by Daniel I just want to precise that
we will be doing a specific session on moral imaginations and that Phoebe also showed up
in this session as like the advisor to the continence project and foresight fellow
so on it will be actually on May 4 and we will have I mean I'll let you explain Phoebe and what
moral imagination is and what this session maybe might look like and you know if you want to just
go for it and has have any remarks on what Daniel has just said about continence project in general
