reality and it says the model is useful but it's not real it's not it's not the reality it's just
useful and it'll also be problematic and we'll have to change it and taking the model as if it is
more than that is kind of false idol worship which ends up being the you know path to the dark
side to good intention thanks um i'm just looking at the questions on slider there's a lot of them
that are anonymous but uh there's an uploaded one luke am i right yeah i mean i think we should go
for the first one which is i mean we've we've brushed on it as through so many angles but perhaps
asking indirectly is still very interesting which is the question of governance and how we can get
both effective and legitimate governance in this world where the of which the mental complexity
is i said in the question for beyond the mental complexity of the average citizen
um yeah and perhaps um i mean i guess all these questions we could spend a really long time on
it but um your shortest answer possible um so that we can take as many of the the questions of people
who are here in how do we do governance in a situation where the infocomplexity is beyond
what can be synthesized in a single person is that the question yeah i think i think that's the
question yeah so obviously the question is where does the information complexity get synthesized
what is if not a person what is a capacity and this way a lot of people turn to ai the other
answers collect is ci collective intelligence so what is a capacity that can process the actual
complexity of it adequately to come up with appropriate choices a few things i would say
here one is even though information or just total data grows on a exponential curve what is really
necessary for us to contemplate and choice making it has to do with starting to make sense of that
data and get meaning out of it the kind of real situational intelligence to inform meaning is a
second or third derivative of that and you can involve machine learning to help process pre-process
chunks of that without needing it to be true agi that creates an interface layer between humans
being able to get stuff that is partially pre-processed but that then needs general intelligence
then the question is what are the collective intelligence processes between people and i and
it this would take a whole session to even start to unpack but i'll say a couple parts
the quote by Charles Kettering that a problem fully understood is half solved
and the corollary being that a problem not understood is actually unsolvable because
you don't even know what you're trying to solve properly there's a process of getting design
constraints that needs to be factored into any problem solving process where you have to say
do we understand the etiology of the problem and the problem embedding landscape meaning not just
this problem those sets of metrics but the other things it's connected to well enough
that our solution is addressing what caused the problem addressing the intrinsics of the problem
and not externalizing harm to adjacent things and so and you've got to separate there is a kind
of first second person part of that in the third person part which is what are the things we value
that we care about that can't be measured and then and maybe we can measure things a corollary
but it's ultimately a value and then what is the third person sense making about what is actually
happening and the forecasting of what would the effect of a particular action be and so there's
different epistemologies that you apply to kind of third person sense making to forecasting and to
second person values generation and so we have to take the partial sense making that lots of people
have and lots of groups have and be able to bed to verify fault you know falsify verify and then
synthesize it and then we have to also do values generation that way okay so you're mainly focused
on the environment you're mainly focused on the economy you're mainly focused on national
security why does that thing matter okay now let's separate your desire for national security from
your strategy because your strategy requires fucking the environment let's separate your
value on the environment from your strategy because it involves fucking the economy let's just say
we care about the environment what are the key things that have to be paid attention to here
we care about national security what are the key things maybe there's some assumptions that we can
get rid of maybe the strategies jump too quickly to a particular strategy because they weren't
looking at the rest of it but if we put all those values together and then say is there a
synergistic satisfactor or a better synergistic satisfactor that addresses all of those values
that's a really key part that is radically under addressed in most any kind of system of governance
and can that be decomposed so we can do it in parts but then recompose with thought on wholism
it can now it needs people that are oriented to incapable of doing that plus it also needs
systems that are capable of doing that and who's going to build the systems people that
understand it which is why it has to start with the people and so this is why starting with
some people right in a culture first is a starting point to a hopefully auto putting process
that is not a adequate answer but it was what seemed like something
we could definitely spend a session on it um actually i'm pretty excited also about the
next question and i think it might also get into uh it's more deeply and um i think it was asked by
eric eric do you feel like giving a bit more context on your question on whether the
confidence project is a modernist post-modernist or meta-modernist project and um yeah
yeah sure can people hear me you hear me okay great um uh this has been really interesting
thanks uh i realized that this frame in the frame of the question might not feel helpful but um
and you know maybe this is uh just made us on my mind this this framing because i'm we're doing a
session tomorrow on sort of meta-modernism so it's yeah sort of fresh on my mind uh but i thought
there were a lot of overlaps and resonances here between conciliants and the meta-modernist sort
of political framework um and i thought that the meta-modernist framework might actually offer some
some insight here but sort of side note to this which is that um it's often hard to choose which
frameworks to use especially because there are so many of them to sort of be vying for um as
Phoebe called i think the meta-theoretical framework uh status so um it seems like there
there's sort of a lot of meta-theoretical frameworks and almost like an a sort of meta-theoretical
framework industrial complex we have to deal with here you know when theorists make their
livelihood after often producing these sorts of things um you know you're running the problem
maybe that that conciliants is trying to solve which is like you can sunset a project we can't
sunset a theorist um and maybe we need to sunset theorists and i say that as a theorist you know
i don't mean that with any hostility um there's just so many concepts i guess that that uh we try
to relate anyway so the question of modernism post-modernism and meta-modernism uh i'm wondering
whether um in a sort of reductionist sense uh you know if we think of met modernism as or a
modernist project as being trying to sort of universalize a particular logic and its sort
of associated force in a post-modernist project maybe syncs seeks a sort of foundationless exchange
of forces and logic so many different things sort of existing side by side um a meta-modernist project
would seek to sort of reconcile diverse experiences within a unified whole and it feels like conciliants
is working on that i mean i feel like uh they know many other things you've been speaking about here
seem to relate to that idea um so i think you know someone like benjamin bratton maybe is doing
more of a modernist project trying to build sort of planetary governance and terraforming the whole
planet maybe pluriversal concepts or more post-modernist right trying to sort of uh create
you know human civilization this sort of ecosystem with harmonious ontologies and their
associated cultures living aside each other um but the conciliants project yeah it seems
quite meta-modern uh particularly this effort to reconcile diverse perspectives and experiences
into something coherent so i guess the the thought i had around sort of trans media and
sort of tracking down what you call the deeper generator functions beneath the world's major
problems um yeah just has has some real resonances here with with um hansi frinox idea of sort of
transpartisanism so this idea that one should seek to um sort of create an interchange between all
parties and truly listen to where those parties and perspectives are coming from so rather than
winning i think as you put it earlier you're trying to actually resolve tensions and i think this
relates maybe to some of the democratic questions that are in some of the other questions you know
someone like john dewey would say that you know democratic culture isn't just about voting in
fact that's the bare minimum what you really need is like a public that's invited to participate in
democracy and then that brings them into a culture of sort of democratic participation
and education and discussion and so forth um so i guess i guess one of the things that
metamonism seems to be doing that i haven't found the conciliants project um is this question of
like the individual and addressing the way that like the individual i think if we're to think about
democracy in a sort of complex way it's not just about individuals making choices it's about groups
of individuals sort of finding their collective interests and then voicing those through democratic
institutions and uh the metamonist project tries to sort of look at um this i have like this idea
of trans individualism so like not just thinking about the individual or the collective but kind of
like the shuttle between the individual and the collective and so i guess the question i'm trying
to ask really here is whether metamonism might help you to think about sort of group participation
in democracy and whether whether the the sort of basic unit that you're trying to address your
historical agent or whatever is the group rather than the individual thanks yeah yeah good increase
so the metamodern movements and thinking um and the integral movement and thinking are obviously both
relevant connected uh number of the people who are in the kind of core team of conciliants have been
contributors to metamodernism um friends with hansi and you know that kind of work um and integral in
their uh i would say that they definitely have some shared ideas and adjacencies and one way of
thinking about it is the thing that integral sometimes calls tier two in a very simple way a
relevant thing of talking about is operating intentionally at the level of synthesis kind
of in a simple hegelian dialectical sense is have we understood a thesis well have we understood
an antithesis well do we understand how they relate and is there a higher order uh perspective that
doesn't put them as dichotomous but holds them as being part of a kind of a higher order understanding
so individualism and collectivism need to live in a synthesis and so we can see failure modes of
societies in either direction advantage the individual in a way that leads to tragedy of the
commons type collective issues and and chaos issues or advantage the uh commons and collective in
ways that lead to too much imposition and lack of freedom etc on the individual and we can see
so many propositions for new social models that fail on either of those sides so instead we want
to say what is the relationship between the individual and collective bi-directionally
how do collectives condition and support individuals how are collectives created by the
emergent behavior of lots of individuals and how do we get a virtuous cycle between those
and so you know you'll see things like no we don't like welfare um and so we don't want ubi
anything welfare like because we want agentic individuals um we don't want ones that depend
on the system and create free rider issues and that kind of thing uh but then a particular
model of doing that that doesn't recognize that everybody doesn't get access to the same healthcare
and the same education or the or the same type of developmental environments and so um a lot of
people are left in utterly fucked situations that then ends up damaging the society as a whole
most of the answers fail in one of the two directions but if you instead say okay well how
do we do how do we do support individuals in a way that increases their sovereignty and agency
rather than increases their dependence how do we support the kind of increasing uh individuality
and citizenry capacity of people so that you have collectives or yeah we'll say collectives that are
conditioning healthier and more autonomous and free thinking individuals who are also oriented
to contribute back to a better collective and you get a virtuous cycle of both up regulating
that's the kind of thing that I would say any cultural enlightenment has to get
some version of that and in Indian cultural enlightenment to Chinese cultural enlightenment
and Islamic cultural enlightenment that would draw on some of the unique history and worldview
and heritage they they would all still need to get that thing right they would all need to get
the synthesis of rights and responsibilities which relate to individual and collective all of those
deep kind of polarities um and metamodernism is basically I mean one way of describing it is
post post modernism if modernity was an answer to the question of like we can see that modernity
gave rise to modern democracies and open society which is if the scientific method allows us to
all come to the same conclusion on things there's an inherently unifying element of it
and if that combined with a Hegelian dialectic of being able to take each other's viewpoint
and then seek a synthesis and those were both key aspects of modernity right
then we don't have to have some few people impose government on everyone because the people can
come to shared sense making and have shared choice making that's effective because it was
clear you couldn't there are cultural antecedents to democracy you can't do shared choice making on
people that have no basis of reconciling what they value or their views of the world and so
modernity was a you know a reconciliation basis post modernism identified good real critiques of
both epistemic failures in modernity and ethical failures in the results of it in the institutions
they created but if it stays at deconstruction you don't yet have a new way of coordinating
effectively and if we say there is no way to come to understand truth then all there is is power
and now we're definitely extinct because then that's actually reifying the basis of the multi
polar traps in the game theory and so we have to say no there is actually a basis for choice
making beyond power and it it is our ability to take partial epistemologies and synthesize them
and it does take good it it does take certain kinds of values and good faith effort to be able
to do that so I would say align with metamodernism in that way and then the where there are distinctions
are healthy details healthy details to be able to you know have conversations that are running
different versions of it awesome thank you and it's a very interesting exchange okay the next
question is perhaps shorter to answer this strength of the movement depends on its alliances
I think quoting the the continuance project website who are your allies
well who are allies right now and who they will be obviously we hope is different to
hopefully some of the people on this call and groups that they know of what become allies
and the allies all so actually I want to step back I would say that there is a implicit unofficial
official alliance with everyone that is working towards anything that would fit within the
existential hope umbrella including and even if they aren't framing it that big if they're working
towards a healthier fourth estate healthier education healthier governance healthier economics
healthier social systems there's a there's a sense that we identify as allies with what
they're trying to do and would want to support it in terms of people that we're actively collaborating
with we're actively collaborating with the Center for Humane Technology and Tristan and that crew
we're actively collaborating with the the Helena group who maybe this group knows less they're kind
of they kind of founded with a idea of the idea of liberal democracy is that any good solution
should get implemented by the market or the government but there are some good solutions
that aren't being implemented why is that there's some failures in government or market they're
not trying to solve the how to make markets and governments better they're trying to be a shim
of how do we get the good solutions catalyzed to a place that either government or market will
take them over afterwards where some catalytic potential is needed and so we're working on a
number of projects with them we have some allies that are in the intelligence space which is
important for the situational assessments and the kind of sense making ergo and bismarck and
ones like that uh yeah so it could go on but uh more allies will be listed on the site soon
maybe is there anyone who was forgotten in the allies or that you feel you want to mention
um i i don't think so i think there's i think the the potential and the exciting part is probably
the potential allies um and and we haven't really gone very much into um politics here and the kind
of left and right and and the fact that i mean in in my eyes and what really originally drew me
to the project was this idea of kind of different political persuasions and ideologies uniting behind
you know epistemic justice and sense making and i think there are a lot of really interesting
organizations doing work in that space who will be excellent um allies
yeah we've had the fortune of talking to uh people in the new biden administration
and people in dc who've been in congress rescinded for a long time and who even if they have been
actually the um the people waging partisan warfare uh historically are more concerned
about it than they have been in terms of recognizing i guess very interesting how many people in dc
i've spoke with in very senior positions who are afraid of the end or irrelevance of the us
in a way that they weren't even a few years ago and as a result or think thinking and willing
to think more deeply about it seems like we need some approach that is different than who wins every
