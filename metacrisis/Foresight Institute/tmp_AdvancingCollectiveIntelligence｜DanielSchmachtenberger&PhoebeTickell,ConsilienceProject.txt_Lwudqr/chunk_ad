just just go for it you have the floor thank you yeah it's brilliant to hear you talk about the
project Daniel I mean we've talked a lot about conciliance so but every time I'm you know it's
like stimulating a lot of thinking and framing and I guess for me what it feels like the project
is doing that's really important and needed is this kind of framing like if we think about
the need for movements in this in this next few decades like this the kind of scale of change
that's needed to move from a kind of doomed society and civilization to one that has a chance of
long-term flourishing this this sort of framing I mean you didn't really go so much into the
social theory part of the project but this this thinking and framing and ability to
give people an understanding of what sorts of projects are worth working on and and how to
coordinate and how to make sense within a larger frame of what is needed it's it's kind of like a
meta theory of change is kind of how I've been thinking about it's like offering a meta theory
of change that a lot of more micro theory of changes can kind of self evaluate and and fit
around I also think it's you know I think a really key thing that you you have highlighted and talked
about is this connection between sense making meaning making and choice making and you know
ultimately this being perception and and the ability to make sense of the world the ability to
make good choices and then conciliance also giving you know theories and and thought out
yeah theories and hypotheses on what sort of work is needed
yeah but I'd like to I'd like to hear you go more into the social theory part but maybe we can
come back to that I guess what I am interested in is like I completely agree with with the entire
thesis but the big the big task at hand is like how to how to improve sense making how to how to
you know really build the capacity of citizens in epistemic justice in you know kind of reclaiming
perception you know perceiving complexity being able to do that kind of complex thinking
and so this is really how it connects with the work that I have been doing and I'm passionate
about which is really this capacity building on the practice level and and you know there's a big
question around how do you scale that you know how do you get that kind of work out into the world at
scale and I can go into moral imaginations a little bit but I'm also conscious that as
Lu says we'll have a two hour session on 4th of May where I will offer one of the exercises that
we've developed and prototyped with now 400 people and then we can go into it a little bit and I would
love to you know get your feedback if you want to come to that session and dive into that work and
talk about yeah the potential of it but I can just say on a kind of high level that work for me has
really been inspired by actually diving into the concept of moral imagination which to me is really
about reigniting a movement and I'm really excited about you know this framing of movements
a movement of bringing kind of morals and and virtue I really like this phrase specific virtue
like bringing the that like values of what is important back to the center of what we do
and bringing it alive through a kind of rigor of feeling a rigor of imagination which is a weird
thing because it you know it's like how do you do that how do you do imagination and feeling
rigorously which I think is is a it's a big task but to me that what's interesting to me is how do
we get out of just the theoretical and kind of intellectual level because to me sense making
is embodied and it and it's it's based it's also involving feelings and emotions and perceptions
and and that you know warm data of memories identity who we are the you know the thing I'm
grappling with there is is how to scale that because you know how do you do that is it is it
kind of self-organizing like small groups of local citizens with who are trained or who have
um yeah sort of run sheets or instructions on how to host these processes that that's a whole
question that we can go into um but that those are the kind of questions that I'm grappling with
because I I yeah I think to compliment the work that that Daniel's just been talking about which
which I feel is very much focused on the kind of understanding and framing and and it's quite
intellectual and and feel free to push back at that Daniel or I'd love to get get into that a
little bit but it does feel quite intellectual and I guess one of my questions is how how can
we complement that with uh yeah the shifts in perception and the sense making that requires
kind of depth of experience and shared uh process and um yeah maybe even the collective
doing that sense making together
you notice how it's something like girdles and completeness theorem logic can notice its own
upper boundaries right uh in tarski's theorem it's
a kind of formal logical analysis of the upper bound of what formal logic can do
that a formal system can identify its own validity but not soundness soundness is something
outside of that system so what is that um the idea that intellectual capacities and the values
are separable is like it's not a real thing and I think you know that um to even
invest in intellectual capacity shows a value there's something that one values that creates
that investment right they might value truth or value um they might value knowledge or any kind
of thing but at the basis of it there's some value of truth that has to do with some respect for
reality that is the thing you actually wanted to kind of deepen the awareness and emphasis of
but why we say conciliance right though that that word means being able to take many different
perspectives and different epistemic and values perspectives on the same topic and get different
insights about that topic so you actually get a richer more multi-dimensional understanding
through take many perspectives so rather than the idea that the perspectives are here to debate
or fight with each other and one is going to win it's no we actually want to take all the them that
we can this is the uh this is diversity and then synthesis right um and so if I really value good
sense making I have to value understanding other people understanding their views right which is
why this steelmaning is fundamentally an empathy exercise if I'm going to steelman another view
I'm going to say I'm actually going to transcend tribalism and in group outgroup dynamics and
rather than say those guys are bad because they're saying something that seems threatening or scary
to me and I uh I'm going to actually seek to understand well why would I do that and I'm
just going to try to win whatever the cultural war the political war with them is well because
they don't stop existing when I win this is a this is the short-sightedness of cultural arms races
if I use if I win a political campaign or I win a messaging campaign for the
to you know be able to change some law or some dominance I guess of the thing
the people who feel otherwise don't stop existing and whatever new better
memetic warfare technique tool or um voter engagement process I came up with they reverse
engineer just like actual weapons and then utilize back and what you get is just an
exponential increase in narrative war an exponential increase in cultural war
and exponential war of any type self-terminates and so the idea that you can just like we're
right and good the other ones are wrong and stupid we have to use the best tools to get
everybody to believe in our version of climate change or vaccination whatever the fuck the
thing is that we're sure we're right and good about like that thing doesn't work if anybody pays
attention you get battle wins and an increasing escalation of the consequentiality of the war
as a whole um and so when you start to get that you're like okay is there a way to transcend the
war is there in-group outgroup dynamics are old we we have a tribal origin but tribal warfare
multiplied by exponential tech self-terminate so how do we get past in-group outgroup dynamics
we've unified our in-groups beyond a tribal scale by a shared enemy but you don't get to
keep doing that in a multi-catastrophe weapon world that you can't put mutually assured destruction
on and survive so we need some new method of cohesion that doesn't make enemy that doesn't
require enemies as soon as people start to get that then it's like well we actually have to
coordinate the von Klausowitz said war is politics by other means but the other side of that is
politics or being able to come to coordination agreement with each other is how you sublimate
warfare which is the the other default that you get so if the warfare is too costly you don't
want to do the warfare then I can't just try to beat the other guys right I have to actually
say how do we come to see reality in a similar way and come up with something we can all get on
the same page with and I can't do that if I don't understand where you're coming from if I can't
inhabit the position and if I try to do it with pure rhetoric right like I'm I'm just going to try
to say the words like a GPT-3 algorithm would do it of your position I won't be able to actually
inhabit why that those values matter so much and how your position is going to change when a new
thing comes about when I really inhabit it I start to get the generator function of where
you're coming from so I can come up with solutions that might actually work for you
and I actually care about where you're coming from and so steelmaning seems like this logical
argumentation method and what it really is is empathy across in-group out-group dynamics
to be able to say we actually have to understand the values that everyone is in service of in the
way they under they are seeing the world and we have to understand it in a non-pejorative way
to have a possibility of both seeing truth and coordinating well um so the idea that you could
do an effective intellectual thing without a deeply relational uh and embodied an ethical
thing is actually a fallacy I would say I'm not sure I agree because I think there are people
who do purely intellectual things without deeply empathetic positions all the time
but I appreciate what you're saying is oh it's just they're wrong well sure but I guess the
what you're trying to do is to is to shift culture and to get people in you know to take
take up this kind of new culture of sense making with this care and virtue and I think
does that make sense does that it's that it's not that you can't do an intellectual thing it's
that you won't get the right answers so that even if what you're caring about is true just truth I
don't give a shit about the other people which would be nonsensical because as soon as I realize
if I even give a shit about my thing that I care about I don't want escalating arms races
I get it I I get it and agree what what I mean is like how to shift minds and hearts to that
place to the place that we're both talking about that we need to get to to have this sort of movement
with citizens that's that's the bit that I think I'm interested in well so for for some people
realizing that the in-group win that they really passionately care about is going to fail
in exorbitantly going to fail if they don't get past in-group outgroup that is a motivator to be
like fuck I have to understand those guys I have to and and it's the beginning right because there's
a belief that the current thing will succeed it is a part of continuing to do it so being able to
get that it'll fail and that they have to approach it that way is is a starting point now how do we
now how do we actually get it to happen so this is what we talk about movement building and do you
think about and and I don't mean movement in the way we normally think of movements I mean movement
building more like the the hippie movement is a good example because it had to do with environmental
values and feminist values and environment and globalist values and free love and all kinds of
things it wasn't a specific movement it was a zeitgeist it was totally decentralized who
led it nobody led it John Lennon wasn't the leader you know it wasn't led by um the black panthers
or one green piece they were all parts of it it was a zeitgeist the same as like modernity and
the enlightenment or any of the any kind of enlightenment like that so what we're talking
about is a something that has to become like that so for instance
who's going to read 45 minute articles with big words not everybody right like some people who
are oriented to that and care and then some of them say okay I have a podcast I'd like to talk
about this in a way that makes this available to a lot more people and I know how to speak to the
audience that I speak to or I have a TikTok channel and I read this and I'm just interested and I'm
going to talk to my Gen Z audience or my hip hop audience or my whatever it is because it appeals
to someone who's adjacent to knowing how to do that through art through media through other methods
so we had somebody contact who's working on a rap battle platform with a lot of the top rap
battlers and he's like the reason I'm wanting to do this rap battle platform is because the
rap battle is a way to take the aggressive pissed off rivalrous energy and sublimate it through art
but they can be in it and to be good at freestyle rapping you have to develop language skills
and thinking skills so it's a way to actually create a desire to even to take their anger to
take their ego and have it develop them in some way and sublimate the violence
so he's like well what if we got the best rappers around and that they want to rap on police violence
and racial issues and whatever and you're doing pieces on that that are more comprehensive you
will train them up on those pieces they'll come do this rap battle thing and everyone be like
fuck how did you learn all that stuff how do I learn all that stuff and it starts to create an
incentive within a specific channel and you know you can start to imagine all of the different
subcultural groups having different ways of being approached I would have never thought of that and
there've been a number of other ones like that that I wouldn't think of and that's the point right the
point is you don't have to try to think through all of the steps in in a auto poetic system you
have to say can we put something forward that some people will resonate with and then their
collective intelligence gets to know how do they continue to advance that front so getting auto
poetic collective intelligence can we get something where some more people are more actively engaged
and now the system is smarter that thing converges to where it means to go and I think a key part
of that is also that constituents plans to offer you know innovation prizes and do this kind of
tending and building of resources and capacity of these movements just to dovetail on that and I
kind of want to hand it over to the audience right because there are questions in this slide
over I actually I have a scientific background and so like I really came from like a very analytical
place and I've fully come over to the place where I really believe that sense making and
epistemic justice and becoming more fully human like rests on on the the shoulders of art and
creativity and that's why like that's why you know I'm putting a lot of time into developing
mass collective imagination practices which is totally not where I ever saw myself going but
I don't think we can do this kind of sense making without engaging engaging people on a level that
is like past rational like not just the rational it's also just like the that space that space of
kind of as I said memory identity love you know it's that gray matter goo place which actually
the right wing weaponize is really really well and the left wing really does not know at all how
to work with that at that level um anyway that would be a whole discussion in itself which
I'd love to have another time but so the fact that you say I'm a scientist and I moved into
this place was because of identifying started with the scientists because of identifying the
criticality and utility of science and then you also understood that its upper boundary is smaller
than the problem space and so it's necessary it's not we're going pre-science right it's
necessary but not sufficient and so you're saying what additional human capacities in addition to
the philosophy of science are also needed for uh full humans full relationships and a vital
civilization and this is critical when we get into sense making and is it an intellectual
topic and specifically problem definitions and problem solving one way of looking at what the
generator function of the issues is of existential risk catastrophic risk is that the way we solve
problems almost exclusively causes additional problems usually worse ones
and it's because we define the problem in a narrow way the problem is getting SAT scores up
the problem is getting voter turnout the problem is getting CO2 down the problem whatever it is
right well can I do that and succeed while harming something else that I was outside of
what I'm measuring and paying attention to yeah all the time right the the problem is getting GDP
up because that's going to equal increase quality of life in GDP per capita whatever well can I
ruin the environment in the process can I use nitrogen fertilizers to plant uh CO2 sequestering
plants to take CO2 down in a way that drives dead zones in the ocean faster can I like so
so the question is what is the real problem it's actually beyond any scientific model I can ever
give because I can never say what is in the unknown unknown space of things that are connected
that I haven't paid attention to yet but if my vow is to anything smaller than that I will become a
paperclip maximizer under good intention right ultimately I've got to say okay well I'm my best
understanding is these the way these things are connected so we work on it but then we find that
but then we find that we're externalizing harm to some other critical part we have to change it what
is it that recognizes it's not the model of these 12 metrics matter these 17 goals there's something
that can recognize what else is meaningful that is connected it has to be able to keep changing the
thing right upgrading it and fundamentally we have to operate from there and so with that so we can
continue to scientifically make better models but the model is never actually reality and that's
kind of the key insight and there's a place to be able to have a connection to and a devotion to
