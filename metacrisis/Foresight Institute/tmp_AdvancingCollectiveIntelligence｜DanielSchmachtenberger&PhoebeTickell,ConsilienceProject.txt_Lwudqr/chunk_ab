what the Consilience Project is aiming to do is to describe the current problem landscape
in a clear enough way that the design solutions for what are the adequate problem solving processes
we need to implement to be able to address all of the existential catastrophic risks and
sustainable development type goals, the things that require global coordination that we're mostly
completely failing at. Like why are we orienting in a way that causes those problems in the first
place and that is almost completely ineffective at solving them. And ineffective at solving them
looks like either we don't solve it at all or we solve one problem and displace harm,
externality to some other problem in the process. And because somebody's probably going to recognize
we're going to externalize harm in the process, they're probably going to fight it. And so then we
have groups fighting to stop each other from doing whatever it is that they're trying to do because
they're optimizing some beneficial metric at the expense of something else. So, what we're aiming to
do with Consilience is to say, okay, the founding fathers didn't have the problem landscape we have,
so it's not in the Constitution. Mark's didn't. The Scottish Enlightenment thinking of market
theory didn't. Even the Bretton Woods folks didn't. So how do we understand this problem
landscape well enough to say what are the new kinds of problem solving coordination processes
have to do? What do the new institutions have to do? And for those institutions to not come
about by imposition, which is its own fail case, they have to arise from people who understand it,
want it, and are capable of participating with it, which is what is the future of open society in the
kind of exponential tech digital age? And so then what is a culture in terms of what people would
have to value that they would invest in their sense making, meaning making, choice making
capacities in this way. So framing that up kind of theoretically, and framing up situational
assessments of what's going on in the world currently in light of that social theory is a
major part of what we're doing. And so people might have heard of Consilience in terms of a media
point of view. And it's because if you want to run a democracy or an open society, if you're
going to have governance, it's a form by the people that you have to have education, high
quality education and high quality fourth estate or news and kind of media as prerequisite
institutions, because the people have to be able to make sense of the world and they have to have
good information. And the complexity of the types of problems we need to deal with has
gone up radically and the quality of education, the fourth estate of both eroded. And so we're
going to be addressing some issues in that are driving culture wars in terms of the perverse
incentive and technological effects and whatever in the media space. We're not going to try to fix
that we couldn't that has to be a decentralized effort, we're going to try to spec out what should
a fourth estate do, what does it have to do, what could it look like in a post digital world as
opposed to the broadcast world? What are the ways in which it has eroded? And what are some
examples or prototypes of what the future of that could look like as a hope to be able to
play a role in catalyzing a decentralized movement of activity towards a renaissance or a new kind
of cultural enlightenment of people thinking much more deeply about how do we adequately restructure
our institutions and upline from that how do we develop our humans in a way that can give rise
to that? I think that's a fair intro. Okay awesome and to get into kind of the
yeah the what we need to do in order to do that you know like the steps and like the modalities
really concretely into the the project I think it would be super valuable for this community and
also perhaps I mean I hope for the continuance project to be for those two communities to be
mutually exposed I think there is a lot of possible synergies between them so yeah like
if you feel like given the broad lines I would be super excited for us all to hear them.
Yeah Phoebe any thoughts before we take the next step?
Um I have a lot of thoughts I mean I have I'd love to hear you talk a bit about you know when
you say cultural renaissance you know what what do you mean by that what does culture mean and
you said it's about people thinking more deeply and um one of the first things that comes to my
mind is um how you know which which people and how and and do you think that everybody in the world
is is capable and wanting to do that culture or that you know thinking that you envision as part of
where where you'd like the world to be? Yeah you were bringing up the question we spoke yesterday
about the different thinkers on democracy and if democracy is a viable kind of idea at all or if
ruling of an elite is actually a necessary thing purely by cognitive capacity and typology or
something like that uh should we address that? Sure go ahead and then I think getting into the
detail of how the project works makes sense maybe yeah next. We don't have to actually try to answer
the hard question of all of the details of how much of typology is intrinsic and how much of
certain capacities are genetic or in some other method intrinsic um what types of Gaussian distributions
are going to be based on biology independent of conditioning is everybody in the future all going
to be thinkers or are there going to be people who are doing abstract thinking and other people
that are doing art and like we could have that conversation but if in if we just want to start
by saying I think the way the conversation is usually framed has some bad assumptions that we
can dispel pretty easily. Are there populations where the entire population over a period of
generations has been radically more educated than other populations? Yes so we can just do
positive deviant analysis look at Jewish culture. Does Jewish culture ensure that there's a much
higher level of education for all of the people in the culture than say the average United
States does? Of course it does and obviously we can look at Singapore, Taiwan, Nordic countries
and be able to do the same thing on a country by country comparison and where it becomes really
ridiculous to think of it as a genetic conversation at that point because it's across the distribution
of the whole population you can also say are there some populations that train all of their
people in virtues differently? We can also see this change on a generational basis within the
same culture so can we get a Buddhist culture where we have roughly 10 million people flexing
populations over three millennia mostly all who don't hear bugs? Yes can we get a child soldier
Janjuid culture in Darfur where to make it to adulthood you probably have to be a murderer?
Yes like human genetics selected for mimetics we selected for the ability to do abstraction which
made language and tool making and the capacity to be very radically different with not that much
consistent baseline so that we could learn how to text as opposed to throw spears or Mandarin as
opposed to English or this environment as opposed to that one or because we're environment modifiers
because of our tools we have to come not fixed with a genetic code of a certain environment
we have to be able to take in the information of this new environment so the flexibility of what
we can do is huge and we've done most of our social science after ubiquitous capitalism and
industrialization and then took it as if that was just a given that oh human nature is this way
and it's just gibberish right it's ubiquitous conditioning and then treating that as if it's
human nature because it's ubiquitous so when you look at the Buddhists or the Jains or some
cultures like that you say can humans can we deal with the innate violent issues of us being
primates and conflict theory stuff better yes we look at Jews and certain kinds of lines of
wealth elite and whatever we say within whole populations can we deal can we do much better
say cognitive education cultural education the answer is of course yes can we do those together
what what is a meaningful human life what are the capacities that we want to develop in humans
what would that look like and then even just go to Exeter Academy or some highly elite private
school where the kids of the elite go do they get a radically better education than most kids do and
do you get it do you get a displacement of the whole Gaussian distribution sure of course there's
some super smart some kids who do really well at public school and some people who do bad at Exeter
but overall one bell curve is displaced two standard deviations from the other bell curve
and so you're like okay well that that's a class issue right that's not a genetics issue that's
not an aptitude or a typology issue that is a access to the kinds of resources issue and that's
not even addressing all the other aspects of culture that are developing people it's just
school and it's not even a good idea of how to do schooling well one of the so can we develop
everybody radically more yes there's just never been an interest in that like class interests have
never wanted that because class interests benefit from a power law distribution and a power law
distribution of power depends upon a power law distribution of access to information and information
processing so asymmetric information equals asymmetric game theoretic power a increase of
the symmetry of information information processing choice making capacity is fundamentally not aligned
with a power law distribution it is the solution to a power law distribution but that also means
it is antithetical to the most powerful interests in it so that's an important thing to understand
in terms of enactment issues one of the very big questions is in we we also didn't give a we never
tried to educate very well the whole population because most of them were going to be laborers
and you're like how much do you need to know about history and civics and game theory and
coordination theory to pave roads all day or to lay bricks all day or to so why are we doing that
additional costly educational investment if there it's not going to be useful to you there's no
roi to society well the the answer and the reason that george washington said uh an all paraphrase
that the most important goal of the federal government is the comprehensive education of
every single citizen in the science of government science of government was term of art then meaning
applying all of the kind of principles of being able to make sense scientific like principles to
what gives rise to government so that was do they know history do they know military theory do they
know the classics do they know rhetoric do they and it's fucking fascinating to get that he that
he said the number one name federal government in founding this country us is the comprehensive
education of every single citizen he didn't say it was maintaining rule of law because if the goal
is maintained rule of law won't be it won't stay a democracy you will start emphasizing
authoritarian power and you'll debase the democracy if if the goal is protecting the borders or
monetary supply or anything else that'll happen and so the only thing that could keep it a democracy
is the comprehensive education of all the people so the idea was even if they're laborers they're
also citizens right they also have a role they have a civic duty and so there's the development
of civic knowledge and capacity and civic virtue necessary to play their role in the governance
they're not only members of the market right and that was the idea in the liberal democracy
is that the citizens are engaging in the market for the innovation thing market does and that's
one of the roles of education they're also engaging in the government that's another one
of the roles and you can see that today almost nobody and you know I know you're in London and
then there's a different but related story to ideals of the British Empire and in England today but
nobody in the US thinks that they really like have a civic duty that they engage in government
they bitch about government out there but they consent to being governed by not being actively
involved they don't even go to jury duty they don't they don't want to pay attention to what the
government is even actually doing governance about right so there there's an education that would
be required to even be able to do that and you can notice that even the value the idea that
civic virtue is a thing kind of died with the boomers as the last generation that thought that
was even a thing but let's come back to the market issue is oh still how much can we invest
in the comprehensive education if we're looking at Exeter Academy relative to most people being
laborers because the people coming out of Exeter Academy and most Jews aren't going to become
laborers right um well this is where the future of technological automation and AI automation and
rote tasks actually as everybody in here I'm sure talks about that either totally sucks and
becomes the most powerful tool of wealth concentration it's ever been because now the people aren't
even relevant as serfs right they aren't even relevant as laborers and that and the wealth of
the technology is owned by the few technology holders in the power law distribution or it
becomes the basis of ending one of the fundamental tenets of the why market theory was the thing
we had to work with which is the jobs that make a society work need people to do them but nobody
wants to spend that much of their life doing certain jobs so either the state has to force them
or how do we make it toward the people also need the job so it self-organizes which means that the
market forces them the ability to make it toward the jobs don't need the people anymore so technological
automation debases the need to have the people have to need the jobs which is where UBI is the
first concept it's not a very good concept you can go beyond UBI to like access to commonwealth
resources generative shared access to commonwealth resources that starts to become possible and
the underlying coordination or motivational game theory starts to change so one of the big
questions in education is in a future that is post information singularity
so you can't actually know all the information on a topic
and that is post I won't say agi because that's actually a very different issue but at least
very good narrow ai applied to everything and robotics so automation what is the role of humans
in that world is there something that humans are still uniquely uh good at and something that's
connected to what is uniquely meaningful and then what is the role of the educational system in
developing those capacities in people and then what is the kind of synthetic intelligence that is
individual human intelligence doing what is uniquely good at humans not us being shitty
computers because right now we largely train us to do shit that ai's are better at so what is
unique to human capacity what are methods of collective intelligence so we can have sense
making meaning making choice making that is synergistic to the number of people that are
engaging as opposed to uh always leads to tribalism and conflict uh and then augmented by computer
intelligence so the system as a whole is a synthesis a synthetic intelligence of human
and machine for the various things they do and human with each other uh so we would say
the governance system of the future has to have those criteria the educational system would be
preparing people for that and uh will everyone be doing abstract thinking about how to continue to
evolve the system equally of course not just like everyone won't be doing poetry equally or
whatever but is there some element of civic responsibility where the rights and responsibilities
have to be paired that if people get rights without responsibilities you get entitled shitty people
if people have responsibilities without rights you have slaves there has to be a pairing and a
growth capacity and rights and responsibilities is there a kind of civic responsibility and so
thus a civic virtue that that responsibility arises from within them as opposed to just being
imposed on them that still has to be there and certain capacities that have to be there for
everybody to participate in governance yes and then to what degree is it customized does everybody
have to understand microgrids well enough to vote on DOE policy no some people will so how do how do
we do that that's a conversation we can get into in detail but I do think most of the assumptions
about what we can't achieve in education and that are are based on things that are either just
narrative warfare not true there's class warfare and whatever or there are things that are about to
go obsolete awesome super interesting thank you for this also again like primer
yeah I mean I guess before yeah I think that that was also like an interesting vision for the future
and hopefully you know we can we can try to strive for these goals
I guess now I kind of want to ask like how how do we get there and you know what is the
the strategy of the continuance project just because I mean that's one of the the ideas with
this group is often to try to elevate the projects and the humans who drive them who are like trying
to fix things at the moment but yeah I really appreciate actually like I didn't see the value of
everything you you just described and yeah I mean you can tell that I like discussing the
fundamental theory and that's the continuance project is actually doing that better more
formally across lots of things we were just discussing the role of education why education
has been hard some what positive deviants in education are what the future what the future
role of education could be etc all of those topics deserve being addressed better because
a lot of the ways that we think about problem solving have assumptions that either we're never
true or or we're true but are no longer true and so what I'm kind of doing where we're speaking
through that so that hopefully we can think better together about uh how to design a better
future the continuance the core of the continuance project is actually doing that function much better
so basically you we have uh I'll kind of break it down we have two major arms there's a publishing
effort and there's a movement building effort and it's just starting if you go to continuance
project.org you'll see the very beta version of the site we put up a week ago a few days ago
and start with the about us page like it's it's really beta if I
if I had my brothers we would work on it for six more months before it was up at all
