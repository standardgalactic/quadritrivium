four years or you know two or six years uh and that they can see issues like social media has
affected democracy in super fundamental ways where everybody doesn't read the same newspaper
and how do we possibly deal with the fact that people have personalized news feeds that optimize
for bias and limbic hijack like uh and recognizing more of them that you can't do mutually assured
destruction in a very multipolar catastrophic world there's an increased awareness that the
way they've been trying to do things fails and they have kids you know and they're and they
think about that so even if they've been apex predator game theory orientation they're like
fuck kids and people in wall street in a similar position and so i've been seeing an increased
interest in more fundamental and deeper answers as the as when covet hit in particular covet
was the beginning of there were prescient people talking about catastrophic risk but it became a
lived experience for everybody and most people know that covet was a pretty not bad catastrophic
risk compared to lots of the ones that are decently probable and we got to see how not
prepared we were even though we should have been prepared that people as credible as gates were
talking about it forever and we weren't prepared and how bad our even if we weren't prepared how
bad our responsive capacity was and how many adjacent things got damaged right like
the amount of food supply in india that got damaged by the supply chains being shut down from the
closures of travel and in the middle east and in africa the rise of boko haram in nigeria and food
insecurity for 26 million people there are so many issues that happen because this is again the way
we define the problem is the problem we define the problem as covet transmission and created
solutions that caused worse problems because of the complexity of a radically interconnected
global supply chain that doesn't have enough stocks to be able to deal with the flows when
there's interruption and efficiency and anti fragility are usually inversely proportional in
a system and so a system that optimized for heavy efficiency gets a big enough blip and the fragility
starts to show up covet then george floyd riots and the radical partisan conflict between the
trump and establishment kind of perspectives uh and the increased awareness of how social
media is done contributed to that has definitely made people in top positions of institutional
power thinking differently than i have seen them in my life before two years ago
which is promising
um yeah it's very interesting okay great um well i'll take one last question from the
chat i think maybe in we can do it in five minutes um what um so is the question from wealth wealth
maybe you want to just ask it directly sure thank you hey phoebe hey daniel this was great i'm super
excited um i think the question was something around the lines of what was it
right what attractors do you see for inversing the dynamics of limit capitalism
and the attention economy in particular um and kind of in that direction if we turn the
kind of persuasive tech optimizing for attention extraction around what does that look like and
how how does it not become this paper clip maximizer uh that we don't want
do you want to speak to that phoebe
i wealth could you could you repeat the question because i i don't know if i fully
yeah grasp what you're saying so right now we have kind of the attention economy
isolates kind of stage of evolution of limit capitalism which is like optimizing for how
do we get to the bottom of the brainstem how do we get people to make choices that are
less than omnipositive because diction is a great business model so how do we turn that around
what attractors do you see um that could be something like a meta modern revival of the
human potential movement in a way that doesn't suck and that isn't cringe and that's kind of
very deeply connected with epistemic um kind of inquiry but then also turns into
um yeah just just embodied an enacted choice making mediated through technology
mediated through technology hmm um well i wonder if that's possible firstly through
technology it might be that it's not it might be that that's not how humans really regain their full
uh sovereignty and epistemics um yeah i mean the the question without the
bi-technology part is definitely is the question that i've uh i'm i'm very curious about and i
don't have an answer for but i i sense that it's it's i mean the question is sort of
answered by this whole all of this stuff that uh Daniel and i are um currently in inquiry around
um i think it's about engaging a different part of the mind and the and the being i mean the the
technology the the approaches you're talking about sort of hijack limbic processes and and target
and use your addictions and you know use algorithms to kind of exacerbate uh addiction to
yeah material online um and so i guess the question is what is the opposite of that and
a lot of Daniel you you could speak to you know the the sorts of methodologies that i guess your
team has been prototyping and working with uh this kind of epistemic immunity and um teaching
people about how these algorithms do what they do helping build an awareness helping build an immunity
um yeah uh it's it's almost midnight here in London so i i think my brain is like not not
it's sharpest but that's that's a i have a lot of thoughts on that i think it could be like a full
a full webinar but i yeah i'm aware of the time as well that we've got a minute to go
uh i would add some things to that do we have a hard stuff at a minute
nope go ahead i mean people are always welcome to drop off if they need to
add but please please uh go on so you know it's a hard question you're asking and um you know
Tristan and i have had a couple dozen conversations on parts of that and as much as he's in the
center of it it's he's like pulling his hair out on how hard a question that is all the time
i'll address a few parts
so when you're talking about the limbic economy you're talking about a the relationship between
hypernormal stimuli and supply side economics and that if the fundamental idea that made market
theory a type of collective intelligence is that demand drives supply that people want
things that will actually improve the quality of their life and uh that they will look at the
various options that are available and choose the best product or service at the best price
i'm talking old pre behavioral econ homo economicus right and that's true that type of market with a
symmetry of information rational choice making and demand driving supply is a kind of decentralized
bottom up collective intelligence system um and then the fact that humans don't make rational
choices of course starts to break it but the thing that really starts to break it is when supply
becomes so much larger than demand and its coordination capacity of course there's a
symmetry between supply and demand meaning within an industry the total amount of dollars
flowing from demand and to supply are going to be the same but you don't have a union of all
google customers that is working together to coordinate its game theoretic interests against
google but you do have google coordinating to but if google's coordinating with me so it's me
against the you know most of a trillion dollar business and so the degree and they're employing
ai and biometrics and whatever the fuck else that is being employed so it's a radically asymmetric
situation and then supply recognizes that it can drive demand it can manufacture demand
and so as soon as we start getting supply side driven manufactured demand the
under fundamental theory of market starts to break down the intelligence of it as the system
starts to break down and then the best way to drive demand is through limbic hijacks through the
most susceptible parts of people so then every MBA learns at the very beginning optimize lifetime
value of a customer multiplied by total addressable market is the value of your business model
so how do we get everybody to want the thing and to want lots of it and addiction is a very good
way of doing that and once I can customize my addiction drip to each person based on their
interaction in a way that mcdonald's couldn't quite do and the news couldn't quite do and I can
engage every aspect of their limbic susceptibility their social creatures they're lonely they want
to see other social creatures what are the kinds of people they most want to see who are the kinds
of people that frighten them the most with make their newsfeed a good ai optimized thing based
on time on site because the business model is doing time on site optimization as a basis for ad
revenue so we know the ad revenue thing has to go right there's a few things that have to go that
business model fundamentally has to go because you can't have ai doing time on site optimization
now how does that go there's bottom ups ways of of course some people who care about that enough
exiting and building a new thing and then realizing that more health and effectiveness
is created there and it becomes a stranger tractor there's top down things like being able to use
antitrust law and being able to use fiduciary contract law and various things like that to try
to change the nature of how those platforms operate both are hard both should be pursued
um so one a couple things i'll say about hypernormal stimuli in general and kind of supply
side stuff we are more susceptible to hypernormal stimuli when we're in a hyponormal environment
to our actual evolutionary basis this is a really key insight which is when most people go camping
with their friends they aren't checking their cell phone when they're around the campfire talking
and playing music with each other and they usually if they're going to a festival or whatever
and they're more meaningfully engaged in the type of environments that have creativity and real
connection and the the the underlying basis of our kind of tribal evolutionary history and whatever
happening less susceptible to checking the phone less susceptible to addiction of all kinds so
so we focus on the hypernormal stimuli part but we should focus on the hyponormal environment
that creates maximum susceptibility to that which is we shouldn't be living alone and with such poor
relational interconnectivity virtual relationships do not replace real physical relationships
etc so how do you so one thing is how do we create environments that are filled with
healthy stimuli right the right kinds of stimuli so that there is not this gaping wound of i need
a dopamine hit from fucking something that creates hypernormal stimuli maximization well that looks
like community building right physical intentional community building also actual communities of
activity and engagement and practice and and does community building start to actually change we can
say that the post-industrial world created so much hyponormal basis that the hyponormal stimuli
grew in that environmental niche and so we have to actually remove the environmental niche for the
success of that that's one really critical part that doesn't get enough focus another critical
part is in the valley you repeat that what's that can you just repeat the last
about the the the hyponormal environment not getting enough attention how that needs to
be turned around yeah the if you think about it from niche theory if you have an environmental
niche that has some energy and it will get exploited so if you want a certain kind of thing not to
happen you have to actually close the niche for it like one of the core things we have to think about
is why is humans behaving sociopathically so fucking rewarding like why do why do they economically
do so well what is the niche that we've created because in tribes that wasn't the case if you
lied and fucked your neighbor over in a tribe you got kicked out of the tribe because the small
scale forced transparency and you couldn't hide the accounting so there's a place of being able to
hide it get away with it game the incentive system of it that creates a niche for sociopathic
favor and then you get niche creation type processes the same is true for hyponormal stimuli
so hyponormal stimuli people are radically sensitive to in hyponormal environments so we
actually have to remove the hyponormal environments by providing the real meaningful things that are
the basis of a meaningful human life which involve connection to nature connection to other people
and connection to right vocation and those types of things so that's a huge aspect that doesn't
get talked about enough the next key part has to do with hormesis and ontologic design
we started writing a paper and it'll have to get a new title because I think right now it's called
something like ontologic design in the Anthropocene emphasizing hormesis but the idea there is
in a world where we mostly live in environments we did not evolve to be fit to we live in built
environments that are not the ones that we evolve for we didn't evolve in terms of the social
environment or the actual physical built environment and then we engage in digital environments
of the same type so in the digital and Anthropocene age the ontologic design is we
make the environments and then the environments are in turn conditioning us because we're plastic
right so what type of environments do we want to create that would condition the types of people
so fundamentally we get back to what is a meaningful human life what is a meaningful
civilization how do those relate and then what kinds of environments do we create that are having
that influence because you can't say well but we don't want to condition people you can't not
condition people so since conditioning is inexorable you have to say all right well how
do we take responsibility for the fact that that's the case and one of the key principles in
evolutionary theory is that the strength or resilience of the system is always a result
of the hormetic pressures on it right meaning it's it a muscle has to be stressed to get bigger
any adaptive capacity is in is in relationship to a need to be able to adapt to different kinds of
stressors and so if I live in a temperature controlled environment where I'm never exposed
to hot and cold my metabolic flexibility will actually go down because my metabolic flexibility
was there to respond to extremes of or you know wider ranges of temperature if I don't ever exercise
my muscles though atrophy so if I don't go to the edge of my cognitive abilities if I don't go to
the edge of my volitional capabilities I won't grow them and so we grow stronger and people
through hormesis but we've had a society that has optimized for comfort and for speed and for
convenience which basically conditions omni-shitty people right like conditions people that are
maximally not resilient and then also maximally susceptible to more other hypernormal stimuli
so there's a way that every source of hypernormal stimuli is actually in a conspiracy with all
the other ones they're not actually conspiring they just have a shared incentive landscape
um and they and they have a shared niche which is humans that are not very self-directed
and so the the facebook thing will make the mcdonalds thing more likely and then the
porn thing more likely and then the you know on and on and so
we all we all know this thing where it's like the people that we respect the most usually had
super hard lives usually they had some super hard experiences that forged them and you look
at victor frankle nelson mendela whatever right you're like fuck they were they were forged in
something but we also know that most of the really fucked up people had really hard lives and they
were traumatized and you're like okay is there a way we can how do we get one of those without
getting the other how do we get the benefits of the strength and resilience of people that can
overcome environmental difficulties without traumatizing them and making damaged people
i would argue that every wisdom society did that through rituals
through rites of passage and rituals that a this is not the only thing i don't want to
reduce it but that a huge part of what the sweat lodge and what the sundance and what the vision
quest and what the ayahuasca journey and what the yoga asana was about was something that's
actually difficult and uncomfortable that we do not only regularly but together where i get the
strength of overcoming the difficulties and we get the strength of doing that together without trauma
and then the sweat lodge the the key is that it's not hot enough it's really gonna hurt you but it's
hot enough that you think it's going to and you think you're gonna freak the fuck out for like
you start to freak out if you buy it but then you're like okay nobody's actually gonna get hurt
nobody ever has let me calm my mind and and i'm not gonna bail on all these other people they're
staying in here right well who would i be in the tribe if i bailed on everybody and so how
do i actually get some strength over the fear in my mind and now that person is more trustworthy
as a person i mean when i first started doing sweat lodges on one of the reservations the shaman
told me when when this guy bailed on his first time in he said i'll never trust somebody who
bails because they let everybody else stay in here if they really thought it was dangerous
they wouldn't do that and if they didn't really think it was dangerous it means they have no
control over themselves and either way i can't trust them and you got to see the tribal intelligence
that they had right which is we do this thing together and then we also celebrate together
the barn raising is not only do a difficult thing together but be involved in creation together
so if you maximize for convenience all the time how do you have people that have patience and
presence and fortitude if you maximize for ease so you can't but that doesn't mean we don't like
that we need to ride wagons everywhere or go back to horses everywhere like it's nice to have hyper loops
so and and fast computers it means you have to ritually insert difficulty of the right type
that conditions the right qualities in the people and where there is but why would anyone
fucking do that if there isn't a virtue or a value system around that that is actually at the heart
