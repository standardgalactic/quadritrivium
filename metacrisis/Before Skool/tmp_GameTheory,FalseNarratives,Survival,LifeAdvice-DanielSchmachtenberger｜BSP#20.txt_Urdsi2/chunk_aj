that where the powerful forces in the market have a vested interest to do something that is actually
bad for the whole and the whole all agrees we don't want that you're able to check it that's
really the purpose of the state is to check excesses of the market aligned with the will of the people
assuming that there is both a moral and scientific education of all of the people and
comprehensive informativeness of them such that the will of the people would be a good idea now
so it's supposed to be that the state is checking the market but the people are checking the state
it's supposed to be a government of foreign by the people where the there's high transparency that
people are not career politicians they're elected from the people you know those kinds of things and
obviously we do not have a situation where the government is of foreign by the people and the
people are effectively checking the state as a result the state is no longer effectively
checked in the market the market ends up capturing the state so if the market is going to be regulated
by the state in a way that decreases its profits then its own responsibility to grow as a business
is to do lobbying to change the legislation in favor of its interests now the private sector
can pay for a bunch of lawyers to write a bunch of law in a way that the general people can't the
and so we have a world today where the vast majority of all new law is written by the
private sector in its own interests you have a situation of the revolving doors where the
someone from industry moves into the position of being the regulator who's regulating
in the interest of the companies they were just employed by and will be employed by again after
their term is over right that revolving door so if if your FDA commissioner had worked in
Big Pharma or Big Ag and then goes to work there afterwards like what's the chance that that's good
regulation and you'll you will also have things like public private partnerships which are key to
how ai is being regulated right now which is okay because the government is too slow and you guys
don't really know where the current tech is at and because you don't have the money in the budget
for it we the market sector who are advancing the tech and know where it's really at and have the
expertise and we can afford to do it we understand that this needs regulated there's some risks here
so we're going to create a partnership between the government side and the private side well who
ends up writing the operating agreement always the private side that ends up being able to pay
for the lawyers and who in which interest in the interest of regulating their own activity so heavily
that it affects their their market capabilities obviously not so they're almost everywhere that
you see revolving doors that you see lobbying that you see public private partnerships you see
basically a state that is doing the bidding of the market and specifically what that means
is the interest of some in the market not in the interest of everybody and not in the interest of
the commons so is that democracy no right so for them and when your only choices for who is an
elected representative are people that nobody likes in on either side and that nobody really
got to have any good say up front and who might be involved in that process they just kind of
came out of nowhere picked by parties and stuff and where at best you get to vote yes or no on a
proposition but the proposition sucks in both ways and you weren't involved in any part participatory
process of crafting what would be a good proposition in the first place so we we have a kabuki theater
of democracy we don't have democracy right um but we also couldn't have democracy in the 1776
style with these issues so given that we have innovated our tech to the place that we still
have adversarial relationships with other places in the world but they can be spying on us with
satellites in real time and use the information the public has and infiltrate the public through
you know um us intelligence and law enforcement identified that the 16 top most popular evangelical
facebook groups were all run by russian troll farms and so the russian troll farm is curating
the stuff in those groups that turns the people against other people and against the state so
how do you deal with a you know powerful opponent turn them against themselves um a lot of people
thought oh russia likes trump and china likes biden no russia and china both like a us that is more
divided with itself and the same the way that we are with them right like the try to sow division
is a is a thing is a strategy um what we want with a democracy is that the choices that affect
everyone's life everyone gets to participate in the making of those choices as much as possible
that people's lives are not subject to things that they have no say in and in so far as we can also
really well educate everybody and um obviously even when i say we can that's a very tricky thing
who is the we and what are they calling good education is a very tricky thing and so far
as it is possible to have a competent and shared understanding of the world emerge
and effective ability to communicate across different worldviews towards things that don't
just turn into a war then democracy is increasingly viable only in that cultural antecedent
and the mechanisms by which that could be mediated moving forward have to be completely
different than they have been before because the context is completely different
that was brilliantly explained thank you for that and i've heard an idea i don't i don't know if
you've heard this but the smaller the group of people the more trust there is and so the more
open you can have a society so like with your family you want to be a socialist and just
share everything with your community you can be a a communist with your region you can be a
democrat but with a large the bigger you get the less trust there is so of course people are going
to be more skeptical and that's kind of one of the defining features of conservatives is
they're very paranoid and skeptical of the government i tend to yeah
it is in the interest of the
it's hard to even define what this is it is in the interest of the political class
to have people skepticism stay partisan
so as long as the republicans say that the um liberals are the ones who want big government
and are ruining everything and ruining education and etc and but their whole answer is to
not really engage in deep democratic process where they're involved in making sense of the
world and crafting what good propositions would be and involving the systems of government it's to
get the guy that is saying that the liberals are bad who's their guy elected to still run the system
with almost none of their authentic understanding or input and this and the liberals doing the
exact same thing then you get to take everybody's recognition that the system isn't working and
keep perpetuating the system and have them all work very hard to to do something that is obviously
just perpetuating the system grigory bateson coined this term schismogenesis which is where the
schism is actually the generator of the ongoing growth in the system and so you have a movement
say and it appeals to some people and it anti appeals to other people and it's not that all
movements must do that but it's that movements that are crafted in a way that let's say we have
values that are in a dialectical relationship and you have to consider them together like
rights and responsibilities or whatever and one emphasizes one you have a movement that
emphasizes one of these and some people who are really paying attention to that thing will really
care and other people who recognize there's something really imbalanced about a care over here
so you can have a movement where the success of that movement actually really scares other people
in the same way that you said earlier as one nation increases its relative security it decreases
the security of everybody else so now everybody else has to increase their process now that just
means arms race is forever is the only possible answer increasing the total killing power of
the world the entire time while increasing the enmity you know of everybody so it's like this
is not a good in game so similarly you have a movement that says some true things but leaves
out some really important things and as a result it appeals to some people and other people or it
emphasizes certain values not other ones and so that movement success drives its counter movement
and so it never actually wins it's so focused on a near term win but if it innovates any method
of being more successful now we're going to use social media and elections or now we're going
to know whatever it is the other side instantly reverse engineers it innovates that's the same
kinds of things and intrinsic to how one side is appealing to their support base they are
anti-appealing to the other side they're actually driving the counteraction on the other side
so any attempt to change the world that is schismogenic will not create a good world
and if you want to create a good world you want to think about how does this look from everybody's
perspective and what is a more complete understanding of the world that integrates all those perspectives
and how could we move that thing forward that's very different
yeah it seems like a lot of these politicians and the arguments that we hear are just distractions
for what you know the power that's really going on in the background
so um i'm really thankful that you've taken this time to answer these questions and every
time we talk i have to think and reflect for quite a long time because i have some
cognitive biases and things and you are really good at addressing those and and just making
me think of like my blind spots and there's there's certain things that you've said that have made
me think and really just back off on certain things that i'm i feel strongly about and really
reevaluate them and i i don't think i've ever talked to anybody that has had that much of an
effect on my thinking just from conversations you know so thank you you said something really
important that i think is a good closing point people should be really dubious of their own
certainty it's it's sad how much this is true but the amount that people really actually think
is amazingly low and so in general if you give me four or five of someone's political views what
they think on gun control what they think on abortion what they think on climate change what
they think on covid whatever and i can predict the rest of their views with high accuracy it's
hard to say that they're thinking they are in a memetic complex that is the moment you identify
the memetic complex you know the vast majority of everything that i think and so similarly if
you're in a conversation with someone and pretty soon you know what their response is to most things
are going to be and they're actually more predictable than chat gpt is they don't even
pass the turing test right like most people don't even pass the turing test when you're talking to
them of like are they saying anything that indicates that there is some real depth of
consideration and sentience and whatever on the other side um and so uh i think david boom said
that most people are engaged in thoughting that thoughts arise and new ideas come in they hit
the person's existing cognitive biases and memetic filters those filters either reject
or accept the thought if they accept that they seek to propagate it by trying to sell other people
on the idea and that pretty much they're a mostly unconscious meme filtering and propagation system
this is really sad and also unnecessary and so you can correct this but you have to
care about what is real more than any of your ideas about what is real
and any place where your identity is associated with an idea i'm a pro-science person or i'm
anti-vax person or i'm a zionist or i'm a anti-zionist or i'm a conservative your identity
will probably have to die when you recognize that those ideas are very limited and that
there are ideas on the other side that are also good and so similarly if there are ideas that you
hold on to because they support your vested interests like the way that you make money and get
the way that you got your fame and the whatever it is is a good thing um so there is a depth of
earnestness to be like no no i i actually want to understand the reality i exist and i was born
i don't know why i'm here for a very short period of time and then i'll be dead there's this amazing
reality i didn't make i want to understand it i want to understand how it works i want to understand
what's meaningful about it so that i can live in the most authentic and meaningful way possible
then if that's the case then what you are more curious about than anything is your own
blind spots and your own biases and you want to investigate them profoundly you don't want to
ever double down on them so if if you have a you know you make a list what are all the things that
i believe fervently then find who are the smartest people that disagree and really listen
because there might be people who have studied this way more than you know way more stuff and
they disagree for some important reasons and maybe they're not a hundred percent right either right
in fact finding where experts disagree in a field is one of the best ways to enter the field
because if they've studied the field for decades with deep earnestness more than your you know
cursory understanding and they disagree it means that maybe none of the world views or
epistemologies are adequate and you want to say can i understand why each of them think what they
do can i understand where the difference is and maybe because i'm not as invested is there a
chance i might be more plastic and i could see is there a view in which there are partial truths
and what each of them are saying and so to just look at where do i hold fervently to something
and who are the smartest people that disagree and really try to take it in
that will do so much to improve the quality of your thinking your understanding of the world
and also just the quality of you as a human being who will lead with more respect with other people
that will have more authentic humility one of the other things like any
when you start to learn about a topic there's this dunning kruger process right where before
you know a lot about it you can have confidence in it because you just don't know how much stuff
you don't know and then as you learn more you become aware how much you don't know if you really
stay attuned to how much stuff is there like peruse more scientific journals and just look
at how many words all the cutting-edge stuff is being talked about that you just have no idea what
the fuck we're talking about at all i don't know what this kind of proteomics is and i don't know
what this kind of transformer is and i don't know what this kind of metafluid is and i don't know
and just start to do take in more of how much you have no idea about things
and the certainty gets replaced with both curiosity and humility and all
and as a result you start learning a lot more and the fascinating thing is you learn a lot more
so your views get more accurate and less certain at the same time
a world in which everybody worked to have a lot more epistemic rigor
and also was aware of how much they don't know so there's still humility in every
situation and conversation uh that's a world that would actually be capable of some kind
of democratic process working i just finished a video on why smart people believe stupid things
and it was all about cognitive bias and how to overcome it and it's interesting the video
made a case that smart people are more prone to cling to really idiotic ideas because they can
rationalize them better and and we made a case that the antidote to this cognitive bias was
curiosity the more curious you are about things the more it'll extinguish the cognitive bias so
you know just being curious it's it's a great way to live
the smart person can rationalize and the interesting thing is that rationalizing is
the opposite of rationality right the idea of rationality is that we're taking some
like hopefully clear formal process of assessing the world rationalization is you come to a belief
based on in-group identity or motivated reasoning or whatever types of things and then you rationally
backfill why you came there but the reason that you say you came there and why you actually came
there aren't the same but you probably have low enough psychological insight that you don't realize
that and so one should be very very attentive to their own rationalization and motivated reasoning
but the other thing is that the smart person because they have an identity as a smart person
and maybe they are a they have a job as a smart person supported by the people who support them
to believe that stuff because they speak to an audience on the left or an audience on the right
who wants them to be the smart person who says those things or if they started saying more
nuanced things they would lose their support base so it's not just that they're better capable of
rationalizing it might also be that they start to get success and identity associated with
narrow applications of smart just like narrow applications progress it's like audience capture
audience capture market capture incentive capture all those things
yes it's pretty big in the influencer world where your audience is going to want a more
extreme version of the character you're playing and so you have to get more and more extreme so
then the question is who's doing the influencing you or the audience yeah I would say that
the spend more time in deathbed reflections because you won't be stoked on having become that person
right the person that was not based on the most earnest understanding of reality and not based
on your deepest truth but based on the appeal to more status and incentive who won't end up being
the stuff you're proud of that's very deep yeah I live right near hospice so I should probably
walk on over there just check in it's a really beautiful thing to do this is actually one of
the other things that I think is particularly tragic in our society we talked about how in
tribal society the old people and the young people were the actual central axis with the knowledge
