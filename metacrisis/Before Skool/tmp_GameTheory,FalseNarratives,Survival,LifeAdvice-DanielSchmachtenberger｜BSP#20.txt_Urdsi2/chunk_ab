so i clear cut a forest first so the plow was not only the domination of the animals but also
of land and ecosystems right and so a worldview arises and this is a separate point but that's
important is a lot of people naively i used to think that technology is not good or bad it's
kind of neutral it's an empowerment it's a tool we can use it for whatever we want we can use a
hammer to kind of beat someone's head but we can also use a hammer to build home houses for the
homeless so a hammer is not good or bad this is not true tools actually have values built into them
that they end up conditioning in the population that uses them on the conciliants project we
wrote a whole paper on this called technology is not values neutral but the plow is a very good
example by use in you have this tool called the plow but in order to use it it's a totally
different behavior right now i am doing animal husbandry i'm yoking and whipping and ox all day
as opposed to hunting or gathering it's a totally set of different set of behaviors totally different
worldview a totally different conditioning of my experience and my belief and so that tool actually
ended animism but it's important to also understand that it grew the populations because you could
create a lot more caloric surplus so the populations that had it in warfare would totally beat the
other populations which means that for any other population that was like no we don't want to use
the plow we think that's kind of evil and horrible they're going to get killed in tribal warfare at
some point and or just radically overpopulated and become increasingly a smaller percentage
of how the world is doing it so it's not only that that technology ends up affecting the nature of
human minds and cultures it's that it also becomes obligate i've never heard that idea that tech is
not neutral i think that's really interesting and i'm it made me think of like the greatest
biggest inventions throughout our history like writing or electricity and what did those kill
what are those oh yes so there are great um philosophers of technology who discuss this
in depth um with very different views lewis mumford is great to read marvin harris is great to read
so for instance many indigenous cultures hold that the written word was the downfall of humanity
and that's so different than the way we think about it right we think about it as like one of the
greatest inventions of all time that allowed us to store knowledge accumulate knowledge coordinated
a distance like all these types of things so let's i won't explain the kind of western narrative of
why we like written language it's kind of obvious but i'll describe the indigenous perspective is
so again that written language is not that old right ten thousand give or take a couple thousand
years for hundreds of thousands of years there were humans that had cultures that had stories
that had creation myths that had systems of medicine that had music that had you know a whole way of
being and their intergenerational knowledge transmission without being based on the written
word was things like at the center of the tribe was the relationship between the old people and
the young people and the old people who had amassed the most knowledge and wisdom throughout their
life spending a lot of time with the young people was actually the what was considered the
central sacred thing the tribe was doing the kind of middle aged people were really supporting
that knowledge transmission and so the i remember a native american describing why the written word
was the downfall to me the first time and he said are in the past if we had an old person who
had something meaningful to share rather than spend their time with a book and write it in a
decontextualized linear fashion that would appeal to some people in some contexts and not others
or also the love can't be transmitted he spent all of his time or she spent all of her time with
kids and with young people making sure they really got it making sure they connected it to everything
else teaching it in a way that was unique to them and teaching it in a bunch of different ways that
allowed to make sure it was really embodied and the kid didn't spend time as one of 30 kids in a
classroom with someone paid to take care of them who doesn't actually love them and doesn't actually
have that much embodied wisdom they spent time with the people that had the most wisdom who were
totally invested in them and so it's very interesting to think about that they would have
always been learning the content in a context right in different contexts the if i'm learning
about a tree when we're harvesting apples versus when we are seeing if there's you know some bug
damaging it that we're trying to protect it from versus when we're harvesting wood versus when we're
praying to the trees versus you know like they're different contexts we learn different things about
it so rather than here's what a tree is removed from context that key to the nature of the teaching
so the written word linearizes thought you have to have a beginning middle end of the thing it
takes a specific context and it freezes the content in that context it separates the relationship
between the teacher and the learner right there's all those things that it does now of course there's
a lot of things that are very powerful about that everybody can get the same content across a huge
population it can allow for coordination all those kinds of things but yes if you go through and look
at all of our technology as soon as smartphones became ubiquitous almost everybody's sense of
direction went away very quickly and intrinsic to following the gps tool is super useful was
no longer orienting to space and no longer creating maps of space which is a totally
different relation it's a decreased awareness of your environment decreased awareness of
environment is a huge part of the problems in the world so when you start to realize that
if tech is useful you use it that changes the patterns of behavior that changes the conditioning
of the person if it confers advantage everybody has to use it or they lose advantage so it becomes
obligate then we call it human nature wow you said a lot of things in there that really made me
think and one of one of them about the older generation holding all this knowledge they're
like a living library i feel like the rate of change is is happening so quickly now that
in a lot of ways the younger generation looks at the older generation as this useless
life force that's just sucking up resources and doesn't have much value to provide to them
and in some ways it's that's kind of right because their knowledge
is of a world that doesn't exist anymore because change is happening so fast they don't
they don't know how to use a touchscreen at the airport and so yeah are we my question is
is change happening so fast now that are are we not able to adapt to it is it getting beyond us
so a couple things if we're in current time if we're looking at the people that would be elders to
you know gen z and younger people we can't really say that call it the boomer generation
was being raised in a culture that was focused on how to grow wise elders right that that was
a thing that had already been since lost and so if the goal of a culture is to actually develop
wisdom in people if that's its primary goal as opposed to grow GDP or maximize
physical comforts or optionality or you know game theoretic advantage you're going to get
a very different kind of old people and so kind of since modernity and particularly as time has
gone on the goal of developing wisdom in people has not been the goal of our educational system
or our civilizational systems in fact you know with kind of the big the scientific revolution
that gave rise to the industrial revolution we kind of call modernity one of the very key
moments in there was kind of the Cartesian dualism Descartes the domain of mind and the
domain of body or the domain of objective and the domain of subjective are completely different
universes that you can't use the same methods on the objective world third person world is
accessible to the methods of science meaning you can do measurement on it you can do repeated
measurement you can do math on those measurements and you can do science but the first person world
what it feels like to be me what my interior experience phenomenologies like you no one
else can measure it right they can try to measure a brain activity state and correlate it but intrinsic
to the nature of it is it can be felt first person can be measured so the philosophy of
science doesn't directly apply and not just first person but the kind of I but also the we
what is our shared interiority our shared experience is outside of the domain philosophy of science
so he said all right that's for religion and you know science over here what that and there was
this very famous idea that that means that science can say what is about the physical world but it
cannot say what ought because ought is not a thing you can measure in the physical world there's
some value judgments about what ought that and those value judgments don't come from the philosophy
of science so the is ought distinction that the philosophy of science can study the physics of
the world the physics the chemistry the biology etc and understand mechanics by which it works and
say what is but it cannot say anything about what ought and so ought then is the domain for religion
it's the domain for the application of some ethical system to law so jurisprudence
but those systems don't have the same formalization that science does right they actually didn't get
the same kind of empowerment at all they got things like democracy well everybody kind of
weigh in on what you think ought to be and but the tricky thing is that the philosophy of science
that can say what is also has an applied side which is engineering and technology which can change
what is and what is causing the rapid rate of change is the scientific discovery applied to
technological changes that are you know changing everything about the nature of not just our life
but the surface of the planet and so what it guides is this a good technology to build is this
the right way to build it is this the right application should we do it or not if there is
in the in the philosophy of science and engineering there is no ought
well you can see in market dynamics there's nothing binding it if you can build the thing
and sell it and people want to buy it that's it you sell it and then if like say leaded gasoline
you sell it and you basically take one of the most toxic materials that has ever existed that
it took the biosphere a billion years to lock in rock underneath the biosphere so there wasn't
interacting here we mine it pull it up separate the toxic lead out from the rest of the rock that
was keeping it safe turn it into a liquid and put it in internal combustion engines to atomize it
turn it into a gas so that it goes into the atmosphere and goes literally everywhere which
is what like that's what we did to make internal combustion engines have not knocking it's estimated
that uh so the lead from leaded gasoline we put it in pipes we put it in paint but just from leaded
gasoline um is a neurotoxin it decreases IQ it increases aggression it increases psychiatric
symptoms it also increases um issues with bones and a bunch of things like that which is why it
got banned eventually but before it got banned it's estimated that it decreased the global IQ by
over a billion points wow and that it increased aggression by something like 4x wow now when we
think about so what was the ought that said don't do that there was no ought some guys invented it
they put it out there what the market will bear well the customers want they don't know what the
lead does right and so then finally when we see how much harm it has caused we create regulation
to ban it all that time later and all that harm has already occurred and the same with DDT and then
the and after we finally banned DDT we just sold it to Mexico for them to use and still go into the
atmosphere and actually bought a lot of the fruit back and then made a new pesticide that was also
toxic to replace it so you can see that the technology that is studying what is can come up
with something that works for a very narrow goal it's the lead did stop the engine knocking
the DDT did kill the mosquitoes but it did a lot of other really really horrible things
and that's where the ought side has to say should we do that or not are we studying a
wide enough purview of the total set of effects of this is this leading to a world we want or not
but the philosophy of science and the applied side in engineering doesn't have that at all
nor do the market incentives incentivize it because if something is good for a purpose you sell it
you privatize all of the profits from that and it harms the environment radically and
human health radically but you're not going to be liable to pay for those costs privatizing
the gains and socializing the losses is actually how the market works
so now because the is ought distinction says there is no ought to guide what should be and
and in fact when you think about the the standard narrative of science is there's a big bang for
some reason the initial causation problem is tricky and the constants of universe why is the
gravitational constant and the fine structure constant speed of light what they are we don't
they just are what they are and some somehow they work such that stuff can emerge and then
those laws lead to self-interacting dynamics of a completely inert unconscious universe
for like 12 billion years until you get enough natural complexity that comes out of those dynamics
that somewhere on earth biology started to emerge in life and then you know consciousness
but from a universe that is fundamentally meaningless and if you go further not everyone
but most people in that worldview also come to kind of that worldview meaning kind of scientific
reductionism that free will couldn't be a thing doesn't make any sense because it seems like
we put somebody on a EEG or an fMRI they describe their experience or we put them into
you know trying to have a certain experience we see a certain brain pattern so we see a correlation
between brain states and people's described subjective states so then there's the assumption
that that correlation is one for one right that every subjective experience every thought
well etc has a perfect one for one correlation all the way down to fundamental particles in the
brain that's a big assumption because the the level of mapping we have is radically gross
relative to anything like that and then we say well the brain is a physical system controlled
by particle physics and the voltage from a sodium ion determines if this synapse fires
or doesn't fire and so the thing you thought was your desire or whatever obviously is not
and so you can see that there are so many places whether it's the origin of the universe why the
constants are what they were the fact that there was no consciousness for the vast majority of
time and then consciousness was nepo phenomena there couldn't be free will that the reductive
physicalist paradigm is kind of meaningless anyways so odd doesn't like odd doesn't even
seem like a thing that makes sense it seems like kind of a goofy human concept from that
perspective and if there is no meaning then like hedonism is kind of a rational perspective
in which case market dynamics and game theory and whatever okay so but now if you have
no thing no system within science for what ought to be then what ends up making the choice of what
tech gets built and what science gets funded the market does and game theory does and game theory
this is actually interesting to tie it back game theory was basically the closest thing to a
scientifically commensurable theory of ought right what is the right choice it's the choice that
doesn't lose so you assume rivalry you assume a particular narrow definition of when you assume
the application of a finite game to the world uh if people haven't read it there's a really beautiful
small book called finite and infinite games by man named james karse and it's such an important
distinction and i'll bring it up in the context of game theory here almost all the things we think
of as games are what he's calling finite games so if you and i are playing chess you only win when
the game ends right so winning and ending the game are the same thing and that's true for playing
checkers monopoly football anything and so intrinsic to a finite game is the goal you're
pursuing is actually the end of the game and in the idea of an infinite game that he's proposing
is we're not trying to end the game if we're going to model life if you're modeling life as finite
games where the goal is it doesn't matter what kind what happens other than i win and it ended
we an infinite game the goal is to continue to improve the quality of play the enjoyableness
the meaningfulness the beauty of the game itself that's a very different goal and it's a very different
decision theory and you don't get it by maximally beating the other guy and getting caught in
multipolar traps and destroying the comments and but in finite game theory where you're assuming
everything rivalrous then the only the art that we really have applied to the development of technology
is what will win which is why we're in ai arms races right now where everybody is racing for
ai dominance as fast as possible at a geopolitical level between us and china and other players at
a corporate level even and when you're in a arms race you don't go slow and try to make sure you're
doing really the same thing and really you know test all the externalities you don't take the
risk seriously because um somebody is going to get there first and whoever gets there first has
all of the first mover advantage and so you'll deal with the problems later and so
this is actually why game theory matters so much is it is basically the only thing we have as the
currently at as what is guiding all of the technological development all of the major
geopolitical strategy is the a good choice is the choice that doesn't lose and doesn't lose means in
the very short term finite game even if it is destroying the playing field of the game for
everybody well that was brilliantly put and you you had my mind like going off in so many different
directions one one thing that i think sums this up so well is there a scene in drastic park the
first one where there's all these scientists working on creating dinosaurs and jeff goldbloom
comes in and he's not a scientist he's kind of a goofy guy and he's the only one that comes in and
says wait the question is should we do this you know they're all saying look what we can do look
