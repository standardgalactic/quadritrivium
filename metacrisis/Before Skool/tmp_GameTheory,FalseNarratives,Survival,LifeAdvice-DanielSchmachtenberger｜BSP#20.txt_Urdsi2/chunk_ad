ability to get happiness from lots of things and so there are reward circuits in us that are more
addictive there are other reward circuits that are not addictive that are more actually
in so the addictive reward circuit will give you a very quick spike and then it will drop you
and then you that makes a craving for another spike and obviously sugar does this and likes on
social media do this and using filters to look more beautiful than you are does this and etc
most of the things in our world do some version of this and then in the low then you crave more
of that thing and so you get of course more bipolar type experience but you also get an
erosion of your baseline over time you need there's less and less things that make you happy you
more and more need those stimulus and you need larger amounts of them the types of reward circuits
that lead to psychologically physiologically healthy people are ones that don't give you as much
spike as quickly but raise your baseline over time and so the type of reward you get from
exercising the type of reward you get from like meaningful conversation with friends from helping
somebody from time in nature you get reward circuits from those things but they're different
in kind than the reward circuits you get from fast food or from porn or from social media or
those other things but it's very hard to monetize those things on the supply side it's very hard
to sell you any of the things that on your deathbed you will say or what you wish you had spent all
of your time with every person on their deathbed says I wish I had spent more time with my family
and with my kids and with the people that I loved and telling them that I love them and working less
and pursuing things less and and none of the hits that they were spending their life pursuing are at
all meaningful in those reflections but because the supply side can basically market to the addictive
impulse better and it's important to understand that like from a business perspective especially
once you have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder profit you're like legally
bound to that as a director of public corporation one of the core goals is maximize the lifetime
revenue of a customer and addiction is awesome for lifetime revenue of a customer and so when
you look at the emergence of fast food and processed foods whether we're talking about
hostesses and twinkies or candies or coke or mcdonald's they're basically combinations of salt
fat and sugar different combinations of that with different texture profiles
that were actually scientifically optimized to maximize addiction there were lots of split
tests done to see which ones had the people crave them the most again and yet the reason that people
in an evolutionary environment the reason that things that had salt and fat and sugar gave people
more of a kind of dopamine hit was because in an evolutionary environment pre-agriculture
those things were very rare it was hard to get much of them and so if you got them there was an
incentive to go find the things that were evolutionarily rare and that were useful as soon as we make
them hyperabundance then people are dying of the excess of them we built a world we're not actually
genetically fit to and then exploit the weakness of that rather than try to support people to
navigate it well and but it's also that that those nutrients were bound with vitamins and
minerals and a lot of other nutrients simultaneously so the fast food removes all the micronutrients
optimizes those things optimizes addiction and so you can have people who are actually dying
of malnutrition while they're obese because they're so deficient in micronutrients
and so what fast food is to food where you just take the maximally addictive part and strip out
what why we're even attracted to it in an evolutionary environment strip out all of what's
good in it is also what social media relationships are to human relationships
is also what porn is to human intimacy is also what the news is to the desire to understand
the world you live in is what productivity is relative to meaning right stripping out a very
narrow aligned with the interest of the market hit that still has that same thing then you will
feel a need for greater and greater productivity and of course that is great from a GDP maximizing
perspective and not great from a deathbed reflections or the quality of how children
are raised or the quality of the environment perspective yeah that's a really strong point
there and it leads me to some dark thoughts where i'm thinking is our species going to select
for the people that can self-regulate meaning are the people that can't self-regulate who do
give into that porn addiction or the food addiction or all these addictions it seems
like they're just not going to pass their genes on it's like they're just the line ends there
and the people that can say no to those things are the ones now that are going to be able to find
romance and say no to all that porn and say no to all that sugary food the people that can
control their dopamine and their impulses are going to find each other and pass their genes on
it's like a filter
mostly not there's a few cases where what you're saying is true of course if someone is
has a level of drug addiction or food addiction that makes them so unfit for relationship that
they never get in relationship then sure that could be the case but
in general the selection criteria is largely going that has been going the other way you know
as we were mentioning with it was the mongol genes after the killing and raping that made it
through not the other ones and it's the populations it's the places that are willing to pump more
oil do more mining destroy the environment faster they can grow their populations faster
this is one of the classic examples is you know at the beginning of the industrial revolution
there were about a half a billion people 500 million people in the world
and that was after 10,000 years of civilization right roughly 13,000 from goblaki tepi how
whatever length you want to say and it was after two or 300,000 years of human beings
about a half a billion people and then in the last couple hundred years of the industrial
revolution we went from half a billion to eight billion like 200,000 years to get to half a
billion 200 years to go from half a billion to eight billion and in the industrial world in
the developed world what we call the developed world the resource consumption per capita winds
up about a hundred x during that time that doesn't mean you ate a hundred times more calories but
your life depends on a hundred times more calories to make the light bulbs and the internet and the
car and everything work in the form of fossil fuels and whatever that support all this so the
beyond just your body calories about a hundred x the resource consumption per capita and the
industrial revolution level at the beginning of that was already high relative to earlier times
so that's a what 1600 x increase in a unrenewable extraction from the environment and pollution
over a very short period of time
and corresponding with that we see that the population of wild animals the ones that aren't
extinct has gone down 70% globally everywhere during that they're just actually compared to 1900
and uh one of the most mind-blowing stats is when it comes to mammals only 4% of all the
mammals in the world are in the wild 95% of them are in factory farms so we have that many more
animals in factory farms in the entirety of the wild like to have a sense of how big our impact
on the world is so then there were many reasons that our population boomed in the industrial
revolution and this is all the progress story right look at how many more people there are and
all the things we have but the side of the progress story that isn't being told is just like
the victor's story and war is not telling the story of the other side or all of its
own soldiers that died or etc um the progress narrative post industrialization is not telling
the story of the animals in the factory farm or the extincted species or the rising turbo
cancers and autoimmune diseases and things like that um but the main technology that increased
the population was the green revolution hobberbosh and the development of synthetic fertilizers
and it allowed us to take a bunch of soil that wasn't arable and spray a fertilizer on it that
would grow crops so that you could grow a lot more crops in a lot more areas and that was
starting with the beginning of nitrogen the ability to create synthetic nitrogen
and then we ended up adding two more things to that the phosphorus and potassium so that's called
NPK people probably heard about NPK fertilizer so that supported this massive population boom
but it also supported being able to turn lots of forests that wouldn't have been worth cutting
down because the soil wouldn't have been that arable and lots of meadows and lots of other
places into agriculture land for people the NPK as it sprayed on the soil as opposed to compost
going back in the soil is only putting back those three minerals not the 72 minerals not all the
organic matter not everything else which can grow a plant that is very micronutrient deficient in
comparison which almost all the plants we get it's the it's the runoff of that into the river
into the ocean that causes all the dead zones in the ocean so at the beginning of hobberbosh there
were no dead zones in the ocean it's a three-quarter water planet the animals live in the ocean life
started in the oceans there's over 500 dead zones around the world massive areas of ocean where nothing
can live that are the result of that runoff the microbiome of the soil is destroyed when that's
put in which affects the genetics of the plant and the nutrient uptake which affects our genetics
when we take it or our genetic expression at least and so again that it's like one of the greatest
stories in the progress narrative that we got this method allowed us to get all these people
but if you look at the total set of harms that have come associated with that you're like
was that the best way to do it uh should we have tried to maximize the number of people
and um and how much were we decreasing the quality of life the authentic quality of life so
you know as the longevity went up mostly because of infant mortality going down
the morbidity in many ways has also been going up so yes there are people who are making it to 80
but they're on on average on 11 different prescription meds some of those are the side
effects of the other meds they're on they cause a really not awesome quality of life in lots of
ways as well as the externalized cost of the not awesome quality of life for everyone else
when you look at the fact that those curves whether it's pollution in the environment or
species extinction or any of the things are on still exponential curves crossing planetary
boundaries we don't get to keep doing this thing very long so our idea of progress has come from a
very narrow method of defining right our idea of progress is we define this problem in the super
narrow way can we grow more food not is it good quality food not will it not destroy the environment
you know just can we grow more food which from a the market perspective being able to sell it
obviously made sense um can we sell food that people buy more of doesn't matter we're not asking
don't do obesity and help people's health but Twinkie's totally up to that particular thing
so the progress narrative focuses on narrow areas of progress without looking at all the
externalized costs of that and so you can't really consider that I think that's a ridiculous
definition of progress it's a very immature at best generously and immature if not actually just
propaganda um for it to really be progress it doesn't just mean advancement and technology the
level of is it has to also be ought that it's actually better like more good which the philosophy
of science isn't enough to tell us and you can't put into metrics because you can't measure it so
it requires a different relationship to how we make choices what for for us to be having
authentic progress it means the world is actually becoming a better place so for that we have to
say better for whom is it better for everybody including the other species that we inhabit with
and what is our definition of good is it becoming better in the definition of
people's deathbed reflections are noticing a life full of much more meaning or is it becoming
like you know when you look at GDP as a metric obviously war drives GDP to go up
and addiction drives GDP to go up and sickness that's treated with medicine that could
that could have been prevented causes GDP to go up and so is GDP a good measure
like it's a ridiculous measure obviously and so
for us to and you know we said that the finite game you win when and it ends and we're definitely
on a path where the continuation of our win orientation will actually end
the possibility of civilization continuing on this planet to not have that happen we actually
have to redefine and really rethink about progress meaning factoring all the externalities is this
still good should we do this thing right the factoring the total set of things no ability to
privatize gain and socialize loss really saying factoring the whole set of things is this good
thing to do and rather than be bound in multipolar traps find a post game theoretic relationship to
if it is not actually progress for everybody then it's not going to be progress for anyone
because it's just going to drive arms races you get a momentary uptick in your security that
makes others insecure so they reverse engineer the thing and scale it up and the wars just become
more dangerous one area that i've paid close attention to is the birth rate and the population
is not growing anymore like it was it's looking like we're going to peak in about 2100 and already
countries like japan and korea are they're going way down they're losing exponentially more people
every year yeah and so we're still our population still going up it's going to go up for another
couple decades but we are plateauing is this kind of a natural course correction you think
um i think that's a fair way to see it the decreasing birth rate is partly
cultural but it's also largely physiologic right it's partly cultural in that when specifically
women have more education and economic opportunity they usually don't choose to have as many kids
and so that's a part of the story but a huge one one of the kind of morbidity increasing things
is decrease in fertility and the decreasing fertility throughout the whole developed world
does again correspond pretty closely to things like the rise of glyphosate use the rise of
pesticide use and other things that are debasing the physiology and you know its capacity to
reproduce healthfully so is that a corrective populations a very complicated topic you know
you'll hear people like peter zion talk about demographic collapse is one of the most serious
issues that we're facing um it's true that if we have lower population it will cause massive
problems to our world system because if you have less young people coming into workforce and you
have more old people that can't work but our need retirement accounts the economics of the system
starts to become really tricky the other side of the population story is that
before the plow in the beginning of us starting to clear cut whole areas
there were only like 30 to 50 million people and before the industrial revolution in the
capacity for industrial scale extraction faster than the regeneration of the resources there were
only 500 million people and that the curve of human population in the curve of other animal
extinctions map pretty close to one to one and so we've built a human system right a market
geopolitical kind of human system that was predicated upon exponential population growth
which obviously couldn't happen forever it was predicated upon exponential economic growth because
you have to have exponential economic growth of this financial system to just even keep up with
interest because next year there have to be all the dollars there are this year globally plus interest
and that and since the interest is on a compounding curve that means an exponential
demand for capital growth and since that capital to not be debased has to relate to
goods and services that also means an exponential demand for energy use there's a 99
correlation between global GDP and global energy use and also material use which is why the GDP
curve and the material extraction curve and energy use curve are nearly identical in shape
obviously on a finite planet you don't get to do that forever and yet every bit of how our system
works requires that because it was built upon a situation in which that growth curve was happening
and yet it was fundamentally incompatible with the biosphere so we have a situation now where
our civilizational system and the biosphere are incompatible with each other we can't change the
laws of physics of how the biosphere works so if we continue this thing as long as we can
and try to continue it we will end up destroying the biosphere that we depend upon
and to not destroy the biosphere we actually cannot maintain the fundamental logics of this system
you cannot continue exponential GDP growth can't continue exponential population growth
that means you're going to get demographic inversion for a while before you find
stable state type populations and these are some of the unprecedented challenges that we face currently
hmm yeah it's almost like our our biology is rejecting our species at the moment
um i was just our biology is what our biology is because we're so many people are now in fertile
the sperm count is plummeting miscarriages or skyrocketing even things like erectile dysfunction
is off the charts many young men are having trouble and it's almost like our biology is saying all
right i'm going to press the off switch you may want to pass your genes on but we're going to say
we're going to put this to a halt just for the sake of the earth but i'm wondering is the planet
really the boundary like if the population gets so big it puts pressure on us to go outward into
the cosmos we then have to extract off of asteroids and things like that is that
