transfer and sinking being key so obviously we ship our old people out to nursing homes and
whatever where they're on lots of meds and then put in front of the tv with the lowest cost workers
taking care of them and we ship our kids out to the same type of thing a daycare and then a school
with the lowest cost workers because we only take care of our kids if we can't make more money then
it costs us to pay for someone else to take care of our kids extending that further is the medicalization
of birth and death where most people haven't been to births and they haven't been with many people
as they die again in a tribal environment everybody's with all the deaths all the births by the time a
person is going into birth themselves they've been with so many of them they don't have the
unknown and the fear around it by the time someone's dying they've been through the death of almost
everybody they know right and they're the most sacred beautiful experiences and spending more
time with them it also it contextualizes the shit that you think is so important that just isn't
and the kind of self-center and so I would love more people to spend more time with the dying
and to spend more time with infants and little kids and with birth and death itself
when you go to the hospice you'll also notice
that just because someone is old and dying does not mean they lived a life that gave them much
wisdom and you'll see that some people are approaching it with a lot of terror and regret
and agony and some people approach it with like tremendous grace and gratitude and beauty
and it does have to do with how they lived and that's also a really important thing to watch
and pay attention to wow yeah I'm uh I'm thinking a lot about these things lately I recently just
found out I'm going to be a dad oh wow yeah so I've been you know my priorities have really shifted
and you know now I really got to get my act together yes congratulations yeah thanks I don't
think there is anything that I have ever seen that is generally as powerful for motivating someone
to grow into their own values as parenting if you're thoughtful enough to realize
that your kid's going to get all your issues
yeah they're going to get your they're going to get your gifts they're going to get your
issues they're going to get your blind spots they're going to get your all those things
and that what you tell them will influence them less than who you are and so if you
tell them something you can't live what they're really going to get is how you actually are
and then a sense of a lot of conflict and incongruence and shame from the disparity of the
messages and so if you're like fuck I really and and when they're little and very neuroplastic
they're never going to be that neuroplastic again that doesn't mean there is not chance
for healing and growth and redemption later there is but you're like that time is very unique
and their first year their first three years are so much more important to their life than
those years are to you for your life right like you're not imprinting the core of your nervous
system and how you're going to be for the rest of forever they are and so when you realize that
you're like damn I am not the most important thing to pay attention to and so much of the
stuff I couldn't overcome for my own purpose I have to overcome for them so I hope I hope a lot of
insights and integrations for you in that time oh man thank you I really appreciate it and
I'm going to take all your advice to heart because it's left me with a lot of stuff to
think about for sure I look forward to hear the follow up thoughts and maybe we'll come and
do another conversation
