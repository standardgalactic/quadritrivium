Okay Daniel it's great to see you. Very good to see my friend. Been looking forward to this
conversation. This is the big one. I've been looking forward to this one for quite some time
and I have to say I spend a lot of my time looking into deep thinkers and philosophers
and theories and I have to say that your ideas are some of the deepest I've come across.
So I'm going to try to keep up but I'm really excited to dive deep today.
I've been so impressed with the translation that your videos have done of a number of really great
thinkers making it so much more engaging and digestible for people so respect is mutual
and I'm happy to be here and see what comes. Thank you. So we're going to talk about the
meta crisis today and some other things. So before we begin on that conversation I thought that
maybe something that would inform the rest of the conversation would be to define game theory
because I've heard you mention that quite a bit. Yeah formally game theory is a branch of
mathematics that studies how to make the optimal strategic choice under uncertainty
to win a game starting with in two player zero sum games like chess or the Cold War
and it was formalized kind of in the World War II era. There was a book written by von Neumann,
the great physicist, mathematician, thinker and a guy named Morgenstern on game theory and economics
and it's interesting that it was those two together because so much of how our economic
system works is based on the same concepts. Game theory has been happening forever it wasn't called
game theory it's just called strategy right it's just we hadn't been able to apply some of the tools
of math and computation that were able to be applied at that time but if you're reading Sun Tzu or
you're reading Machiavelli or you're reading any kind of general discussing military strategy
they're basically talking about how do you win a rival risk game where you don't know what the
opponent is doing and where obviously depending upon what they're doing some moves would be great
moves some moves would be terrible moves obviously this is chess this is any kind of game dynamic
like that. So there's a the most famous first study in game theory that many people have heard of
is the prisoner's dilemma and I won't describe the prisoner's dilemma in detail here people can
check it out online but the idea is you and a buddy are both in jail you're both being investigated
you're both being given a kind of plea type option if you both cooperate with not kind of ratting
each other out it's the best solution for both of you but if the other guy rats you out and you
don't it's the worst solution for you personally and if you end up ratting on the other guy and
he doesn't it's less bad for you than if you both kind of keep the dynamic in. So what is found out
is that under the uncertainty where you don't know what the other guy is going to do the tendency
is to assume the worst and move into a position of kind of maximum selfishness maximum rivalry
and you can imagine in situations of warfare if you don't know how much armament the other guy has
you don't know how aggressive their interests are you want to assume the worst case scenario
and try to plan to be able to win under the worst case scenario which ends up meaning and the other
guy is doing the same thing if let's say they're offering an agreement but you know they might
defect on their agreement which happens all the time right Stalin and Hitler were participating
when it was serving both of their interests and then uh Hitler defects on Stalin when it's not
aligned to this interest so in game theory there's something called a coordination game which is
you actually don't compete against someone you coordinate with them when it's in your
interest to coordinate but then you reserve the right to defect on them when that's in your interest
and not just in military situations you see that in uh say class dynamics the upper class might all
coordinate with each other with regard to tax policies for the upper class while simultaneously
competing for who has positions of maximum power within that class uh a whole industry like say the
ai sector or oil might coordinate with each other for getting the regulations they want for the
sector while then all competing for who has the most market share so under a game theoretic
scenario there is no such thing as allies for real there there is no such thing as like friends
or loyalty there's frenemies at best and the frenemy scenario is as long as we have shared
interests i can expect a certain degree of cooperation as soon as we don't have shared
interests i can expect defections or continuously planning for selfishness and defection and
that takes up also a huge amount of bandwidth this ends up explaining a tremendous amount about
how the world works uh militarily economically politically diplomatically where we're making
an agreement while assuming the other guy will defect while they are assuming we will defect
we're trying to figure out how to spy on their defection while being able to confuse their spies
you know like and those types of dynamics are a huge amount of the coordination failures of the world
and there are some things that uh game theory and game theoretic thinking even before it was
formalized in math the formalization of it just made it much more powerful and much more
ubiquitous and now you can run it on computers and run it on ai so we can see ai being able to
run those types of models beats humans at chess beats humans at go beats humans at starcraft
now is increasingly beating humans at more generalized things like obviously trading
economic trading and uh even uh comprehensive war planning and targeting of missiles and all those
things um so one type of game theoretic scenario that defines a lot of properties of the world is
if there are a number of players number of actors let's call it tribes or countries or companies
or whatever and one of them does something that provides a lot of near-term advantage for them
it might be doing something particularly destructive like say let's take a early kind of
tribal analogy rather than only taking what they need from nature they're starting to cut down a
lot more timber to be able to create surplus and you have a scenario where that they can then use
that surplus in different ways to be able to win a tribal warfare so now you take the other tribes
if they don't do the same thing it doesn't protect the forest because the other guy's going to cut
down the forest anyways and but and if they don't do the same thing they might not even be able to
protect their people and so now even if they didn't want to they have to race to cut down the forest
faster just for their own need to survive and so you get the scenario where there's kind of a race
to exploit the commons and whether that's fishing or hunting or you know any kind of exploitation
from the environment or oil so you have a situation called the tragedy of the commons
which is a kind of social trap is one of the terms or multi-polar trap where
the net scenario of what everyone is racing to do makes the worst possible world for everyone
but nobody can stop it because if anyone stops it's so much worse for them in the short term and
they can't assure that the other guy's not going to do it and so the idea that because they are
doing it we have to you end up having a world that nobody wants but nobody feels they can choose
otherwise and this is such a deep thing to understand because like let's say you take
any of the major environmental issues of the time I'm going to take climate change because
probably most of your listeners think that's a thing for those who don't you can apply it to
species extinction or chemical pollution or any of these issues
literally nobody actually wants climate change like there's no one for whom climate change is
their strategic objective and yet and the whole world actually in terms of the G20 the United
Nations all of the major countries of the world have acknowledged climate change is a major issue
we all want to stop it there's a trillion dollars in climate related funding happening every year
there's the IPCC having huge supercomputers supported by NASA and NOAA there's international
agreements and yet every single year we use more fossil fuels in the year before
all of the renewables all of the solar all the everything we haven't even slowed the rate of
increase of fossil fuel use and so we obviously don't know how to stop climate change everybody
thinks that it's a particularly bad thing the UN estimates that about a billion refugees from
extreme weather events and climate change will happen in the next decade and the world has no
way to deal with a billion refugees and so we can't stop it and yet nobody wants it what they want
is energy for every other purpose and that's one of the side effects of it and no one feels that
they could price energy properly or be able to consume less because let's say the US priced
energy properly meeting it right now we price oil as how much it costs us to extract it from
the ground plus a tiny margin not what it took nature to make or what it would take for us to
clean up the environmental effects so obviously most of the costs are externalized to the environment
if we were to start to try to price it more properly so that you could produce it in a way
that didn't have the negative environmental effects but say China didn't then they would have more
margins than us they would beat us that's the multipolar trap and the same happens in arms races
the advancement of you know military tech if if they're making AI drone weapons and the AI drone
weapon is going to comprehensively outperform the ones the weapons that are run by humans then we
have to make a drone weapons and if we don't know exactly what type they're making we have to assume
we have to spy on them obviously and we have to run counter intel on their spies but we also
have to assume that they're making all of the worst possible ones plus defenses and try to
get comprehensive advantage allocate larger and larger military budgets and you get a world in
which there is increasing destructive power with nuclear weapons cyber weapons hypersonic
delivery of nuclear weapons drone weapons etc and again literally nobody wants to live in the world
with AI drone weapons but also no one feels that they can stop it and so this multiplayer
game theoretic dilemma where under uncertainty you assume the worst case scenario you race ahead
the net result is this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy is the other guy it does do that thing
whether he was going to or not because he thinks you're going to and you're saying the only reason
you are is because you think they are and the world you end up getting is maximum environmental
destruction maximum weapons maximum distrust etc yeah it reminds me of a story where a town has no
lawyers so there's no lawsuits and then it has one lawyer and there's still no lawsuits and then it
gets two lawyers and all of a sudden everybody's suing each other so it's kind of like i don't
need a security guard unless you have a security guard and then it's i'm wondering is this just
built into human nature this this issue
no and the reason you can say no kind of confidently is because there are examples
of groups of humans who bound these kinds of social traps effectively for periods of time
which means human nature is capable of doing that thing human nature is obviously capable
of doing this thing and obviously very well but it's not that human nature obligately does it
it's the human nature under conditioning environments does it so this is a this is a very
important thing to understand about human nature let's take a look at the janes right the eastern
religion that emphasizes non-violence more seriously than most do so much so that they
really go out of their way to never hurt a bug if they're going to build a house they remove all
the bugs first so they don't hurt any bugs they um eat fruits and nuts that fall from the plants
but they won't even kill plants to eat them the existence of the janes has you know decently large
populations over long periods of time mean that you can have not just a particularly nonviolent
person but a whole culture of people that all get inculturated to live that way so human nature
allows janes right as one example but then you can also look at say the janjuid and uh
child you know child soldier utilizing demographic in sudan where by the time someone gets to
puberty pretty much everyone has murdered people and in that environment if you don't
participate with that thing you don't make it to puberty and so again you have a situation in which
you can have the entire population um i'm sorry someone knocked oh it's all good um so we were
talking about the janes and then scenario where yeah what's that oh so we were talking about the
janes and then we were talking about child soldiers yes so you can have populations that have
radically different distributions of how violent or how nonviolent people are you can have populations
where the level of education is radically different even independence of the economics
when you look at say the jews in the pogroms in russia the way they invested in the education of
the kids even in positions of like you know near slavery and total poverty there was a culture
kind of dynamic so human nature it's a very important thing to understand about human nature is that
unlike all the other animals because of our capacity for toolbuilding
we didn't stay limited to one niche that our bodies had evolved to be able to work well in
the cheetah is amazing for one niche it would do very bad in the arctic and the polar bear would
do very bad in savannah so they stay in their niche right but you notice that humans moved everywhere
and humans ended up becoming like the apex predators everywhere because they were able to
put on skins and build houses and change their tooling set so that they could be adaptive and
actually apex predator and then environment dominating in all the spaces so if you look at
the life of a cheetah or a polar bear today versus a cheetah or a polar bear 10 000 years ago
in their natural environment what makes them adaptive is pretty much the same thing so they
get to have kind of built-in genetic code nature for how to be that thing that co-evolved with their
environment and co-evolved with their body but what it means to be an adaptive human today
versus 10 000 years ago or even 50 years ago is totally different most people today are not awesome
at spear throwing even though that was a super useful skill we're very good at texting and other
things so because we change our tooling stack change our languages change the environments we're in
change the types of political economies we're in we have to change our nature we have to change
deep aspects of how we perceive the world how we make sense of the world and how we behave
so a key aspect to humans is a profound amount of plasticity because we change our environment so
much we have to kind of get rather than hardwired kind of like software adapted to the unique
environments that we're in which is also part of why human children are kind of incapable of
self dynamics right they're called neoteness embryo like for so long horses up walking in
20 minutes it takes a human child a year to be walking because they don't come with the built-in
imprint because they're going to have to learn a language they're going to have to learn all of
these things right and as a result human nature is very radically plastic so if we want to look
environments where there were tribes that were not only relatively more peaceful within the tribe
but relatively more peaceful between the tribes we can see those examples we can see them in the
Iroquois Confederacy we can see them in examples of um inter-tribal agreements in the aborigines
where they didn't define things via multipolar traps they uh came into inter-tribal councils had
conversations had agreements kept the agreements had enforcement that worked so uh is it in is it
human nature that we can do game theory yes is it human nature that we must know but when someone
else starts doing it it becomes obligate to do it or lose and this is kind of the key thing
so it's not human nature it's system dynamics that make it obligate so there's a whole bunch of
things that we think of as human nature because they're happening everywhere because they're
ubiquitous conditioning because they became obligate and so this this is such an important
example so you know there are on your show in particular there are people that can test how
long humans have been around but the standard narrative is sapiens have been around two to
300 000 years a pretty long time and for all of that time standard narrative we were uh
hunters and gatherers right pre having the plow in all the hunter gather cultures around the world
from what we can tell they were pretty much all animistic
and anytime there's something that occurs everywhere it's a bit it's an interesting thing
right it means it's kind of a property of evolution that arises it is something closer
to like nature what is animistic mean they were related to the spirit of everything the spirit
of the tree the spirit of the buffalo the spirit of the river the spirit of the moon and so animism
is the idea that everything is animated by the great spirit in some way and has their own kind
of unique spirit to them so if you study any kind of indigenous culture the way they would
okay we're gonna hunt a buffalo and we will actually cry when we kill the buffalo we'll
make prayers we will say that when our body goes into the ground when we die it'll become the grass
that their ancestors will eat in the great cycle of life but there's a respect for the spirit of
the buffalo right so when we figured out the plow kind of the ox drawn plow we had to figure out
how to take a buffalo domesticate it castrate it yoke it and you know whip it all day to do that
thing you couldn't continue to be animistic and you had to move into worldviews that were like
man's dominion over nature the animals were put here to serve us man was made the you know king
of the kingdom that kind of thing whereas the chief seattle quote we are not the web of life
we're merely a little strand and that whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves those are very
different worldviews but you can't run the plow and be animistic and not only that but because the plow
allows you to do this long row cropping which of course if i'm if i'm gathering i'm not going
to get anything like that to do the long row cropping i need a lot of land allocated agriculture
so i clear cut a forest first so the plow was not only the domination of the animals but also
of land and ecosystems right and so a worldview arises and this is a separate point but that's
important is a lot of people naively i used to think that technology is not good or bad it's
kind of neutral it's an empowerment it's a tool we can use it for whatever we want we can use a
hammer to kind of beat someone's head but we can also use a hammer to build home houses for the
homeless so a hammer is not good or bad this is not true tools actually have values built into them
that they end up conditioning in the population that uses them on the conciliants project we
wrote a whole paper on this called technology is not values neutral but the plow is a very good
example by use in you have this tool called the plow but in order to use it it's a totally
different behavior right now i am doing animal husbandry i'm yoking and whipping and ox all day
as opposed to hunting or gathering it's a totally set of different set of behaviors totally different
worldview a totally different conditioning of my experience and my belief and so that tool actually
ended animism but it's important to also understand that it grew the populations because you could
create a lot more caloric surplus so the populations that had it in warfare would totally beat the
other populations which means that for any other population that was like no we don't want to use
the plow we think that's kind of evil and horrible they're going to get killed in tribal warfare at
some point and or just radically overpopulated and become increasingly a smaller percentage
of how the world is doing it so it's not only that that technology ends up affecting the nature of
human minds and cultures it's that it also becomes obligate i've never heard that idea that tech is
not neutral i think that's really interesting and i'm it made me think of like the greatest
biggest inventions throughout our history like writing or electricity and what did those kill
what are those oh yes so there are great um philosophers of technology who discuss this
in depth um with very different views lewis mumford is great to read marvin harris is great to read
so for instance many indigenous cultures hold that the written word was the downfall of humanity
and that's so different than the way we think about it right we think about it as like one of the
greatest inventions of all time that allowed us to store knowledge accumulate knowledge coordinated
a distance like all these types of things so let's i won't explain the kind of western narrative of
why we like written language it's kind of obvious but i'll describe the indigenous perspective is
so again that written language is not that old right ten thousand give or take a couple thousand
years for hundreds of thousands of years there were humans that had cultures that had stories
that had creation myths that had systems of medicine that had music that had you know a whole way of
being and their intergenerational knowledge transmission without being based on the written
word was things like at the center of the tribe was the relationship between the old people and
the young people and the old people who had amassed the most knowledge and wisdom throughout their
life spending a lot of time with the young people was actually the what was considered the
central sacred thing the tribe was doing the kind of middle aged people were really supporting
that knowledge transmission and so the i remember a native american describing why the written word
was the downfall to me the first time and he said are in the past if we had an old person who
had something meaningful to share rather than spend their time with a book and write it in a
decontextualized linear fashion that would appeal to some people in some contexts and not others
or also the love can't be transmitted he spent all of his time or she spent all of her time with
kids and with young people making sure they really got it making sure they connected it to everything
else teaching it in a way that was unique to them and teaching it in a bunch of different ways that
allowed to make sure it was really embodied and the kid didn't spend time as one of 30 kids in a
classroom with someone paid to take care of them who doesn't actually love them and doesn't actually
have that much embodied wisdom they spent time with the people that had the most wisdom who were
totally invested in them and so it's very interesting to think about that they would have
always been learning the content in a context right in different contexts the if i'm learning
about a tree when we're harvesting apples versus when we are seeing if there's you know some bug
damaging it that we're trying to protect it from versus when we're harvesting wood versus when we're
praying to the trees versus you know like they're different contexts we learn different things about
it so rather than here's what a tree is removed from context that key to the nature of the teaching
so the written word linearizes thought you have to have a beginning middle end of the thing it
takes a specific context and it freezes the content in that context it separates the relationship
between the teacher and the learner right there's all those things that it does now of course there's
a lot of things that are very powerful about that everybody can get the same content across a huge
population it can allow for coordination all those kinds of things but yes if you go through and look
at all of our technology as soon as smartphones became ubiquitous almost everybody's sense of
direction went away very quickly and intrinsic to following the gps tool is super useful was
no longer orienting to space and no longer creating maps of space which is a totally
different relation it's a decreased awareness of your environment decreased awareness of
environment is a huge part of the problems in the world so when you start to realize that
if tech is useful you use it that changes the patterns of behavior that changes the conditioning
of the person if it confers advantage everybody has to use it or they lose advantage so it becomes
obligate then we call it human nature wow you said a lot of things in there that really made me
think and one of one of them about the older generation holding all this knowledge they're
like a living library i feel like the rate of change is is happening so quickly now that
in a lot of ways the younger generation looks at the older generation as this useless
life force that's just sucking up resources and doesn't have much value to provide to them
and in some ways it's that's kind of right because their knowledge
is of a world that doesn't exist anymore because change is happening so fast they don't
they don't know how to use a touchscreen at the airport and so yeah are we my question is
is change happening so fast now that are are we not able to adapt to it is it getting beyond us
so a couple things if we're in current time if we're looking at the people that would be elders to
you know gen z and younger people we can't really say that call it the boomer generation
was being raised in a culture that was focused on how to grow wise elders right that that was
a thing that had already been since lost and so if the goal of a culture is to actually develop
wisdom in people if that's its primary goal as opposed to grow GDP or maximize
physical comforts or optionality or you know game theoretic advantage you're going to get
a very different kind of old people and so kind of since modernity and particularly as time has
gone on the goal of developing wisdom in people has not been the goal of our educational system
or our civilizational systems in fact you know with kind of the big the scientific revolution
that gave rise to the industrial revolution we kind of call modernity one of the very key
moments in there was kind of the Cartesian dualism Descartes the domain of mind and the
domain of body or the domain of objective and the domain of subjective are completely different
universes that you can't use the same methods on the objective world third person world is
accessible to the methods of science meaning you can do measurement on it you can do repeated
measurement you can do math on those measurements and you can do science but the first person world
what it feels like to be me what my interior experience phenomenologies like you no one
else can measure it right they can try to measure a brain activity state and correlate it but intrinsic
to the nature of it is it can be felt first person can be measured so the philosophy of
science doesn't directly apply and not just first person but the kind of I but also the we
what is our shared interiority our shared experience is outside of the domain philosophy of science
so he said all right that's for religion and you know science over here what that and there was
this very famous idea that that means that science can say what is about the physical world but it
cannot say what ought because ought is not a thing you can measure in the physical world there's
some value judgments about what ought that and those value judgments don't come from the philosophy
of science so the is ought distinction that the philosophy of science can study the physics of
the world the physics the chemistry the biology etc and understand mechanics by which it works and
say what is but it cannot say anything about what ought and so ought then is the domain for religion
it's the domain for the application of some ethical system to law so jurisprudence
but those systems don't have the same formalization that science does right they actually didn't get
the same kind of empowerment at all they got things like democracy well everybody kind of
weigh in on what you think ought to be and but the tricky thing is that the philosophy of science
that can say what is also has an applied side which is engineering and technology which can change
what is and what is causing the rapid rate of change is the scientific discovery applied to
technological changes that are you know changing everything about the nature of not just our life
but the surface of the planet and so what it guides is this a good technology to build is this
the right way to build it is this the right application should we do it or not if there is
in the in the philosophy of science and engineering there is no ought
well you can see in market dynamics there's nothing binding it if you can build the thing
and sell it and people want to buy it that's it you sell it and then if like say leaded gasoline
you sell it and you basically take one of the most toxic materials that has ever existed that
it took the biosphere a billion years to lock in rock underneath the biosphere so there wasn't
interacting here we mine it pull it up separate the toxic lead out from the rest of the rock that
was keeping it safe turn it into a liquid and put it in internal combustion engines to atomize it
turn it into a gas so that it goes into the atmosphere and goes literally everywhere which
is what like that's what we did to make internal combustion engines have not knocking it's estimated
that uh so the lead from leaded gasoline we put it in pipes we put it in paint but just from leaded
gasoline um is a neurotoxin it decreases IQ it increases aggression it increases psychiatric
symptoms it also increases um issues with bones and a bunch of things like that which is why it
got banned eventually but before it got banned it's estimated that it decreased the global IQ by
over a billion points wow and that it increased aggression by something like 4x wow now when we
think about so what was the ought that said don't do that there was no ought some guys invented it
they put it out there what the market will bear well the customers want they don't know what the
lead does right and so then finally when we see how much harm it has caused we create regulation
to ban it all that time later and all that harm has already occurred and the same with DDT and then
the and after we finally banned DDT we just sold it to Mexico for them to use and still go into the
atmosphere and actually bought a lot of the fruit back and then made a new pesticide that was also
toxic to replace it so you can see that the technology that is studying what is can come up
with something that works for a very narrow goal it's the lead did stop the engine knocking
the DDT did kill the mosquitoes but it did a lot of other really really horrible things
and that's where the ought side has to say should we do that or not are we studying a
wide enough purview of the total set of effects of this is this leading to a world we want or not
but the philosophy of science and the applied side in engineering doesn't have that at all
nor do the market incentives incentivize it because if something is good for a purpose you sell it
you privatize all of the profits from that and it harms the environment radically and
human health radically but you're not going to be liable to pay for those costs privatizing
the gains and socializing the losses is actually how the market works
so now because the is ought distinction says there is no ought to guide what should be and
and in fact when you think about the the standard narrative of science is there's a big bang for
some reason the initial causation problem is tricky and the constants of universe why is the
gravitational constant and the fine structure constant speed of light what they are we don't
they just are what they are and some somehow they work such that stuff can emerge and then
those laws lead to self-interacting dynamics of a completely inert unconscious universe
for like 12 billion years until you get enough natural complexity that comes out of those dynamics
that somewhere on earth biology started to emerge in life and then you know consciousness
but from a universe that is fundamentally meaningless and if you go further not everyone
but most people in that worldview also come to kind of that worldview meaning kind of scientific
reductionism that free will couldn't be a thing doesn't make any sense because it seems like
we put somebody on a EEG or an fMRI they describe their experience or we put them into
you know trying to have a certain experience we see a certain brain pattern so we see a correlation
between brain states and people's described subjective states so then there's the assumption
that that correlation is one for one right that every subjective experience every thought
well etc has a perfect one for one correlation all the way down to fundamental particles in the
brain that's a big assumption because the the level of mapping we have is radically gross
relative to anything like that and then we say well the brain is a physical system controlled
by particle physics and the voltage from a sodium ion determines if this synapse fires
or doesn't fire and so the thing you thought was your desire or whatever obviously is not
and so you can see that there are so many places whether it's the origin of the universe why the
constants are what they were the fact that there was no consciousness for the vast majority of
time and then consciousness was nepo phenomena there couldn't be free will that the reductive
physicalist paradigm is kind of meaningless anyways so odd doesn't like odd doesn't even
seem like a thing that makes sense it seems like kind of a goofy human concept from that
perspective and if there is no meaning then like hedonism is kind of a rational perspective
in which case market dynamics and game theory and whatever okay so but now if you have
no thing no system within science for what ought to be then what ends up making the choice of what
tech gets built and what science gets funded the market does and game theory does and game theory
this is actually interesting to tie it back game theory was basically the closest thing to a
scientifically commensurable theory of ought right what is the right choice it's the choice that
doesn't lose so you assume rivalry you assume a particular narrow definition of when you assume
the application of a finite game to the world uh if people haven't read it there's a really beautiful
small book called finite and infinite games by man named james karse and it's such an important
distinction and i'll bring it up in the context of game theory here almost all the things we think
of as games are what he's calling finite games so if you and i are playing chess you only win when
the game ends right so winning and ending the game are the same thing and that's true for playing
checkers monopoly football anything and so intrinsic to a finite game is the goal you're
pursuing is actually the end of the game and in the idea of an infinite game that he's proposing
is we're not trying to end the game if we're going to model life if you're modeling life as finite
games where the goal is it doesn't matter what kind what happens other than i win and it ended
we an infinite game the goal is to continue to improve the quality of play the enjoyableness
the meaningfulness the beauty of the game itself that's a very different goal and it's a very different
decision theory and you don't get it by maximally beating the other guy and getting caught in
multipolar traps and destroying the comments and but in finite game theory where you're assuming
everything rivalrous then the only the art that we really have applied to the development of technology
is what will win which is why we're in ai arms races right now where everybody is racing for
ai dominance as fast as possible at a geopolitical level between us and china and other players at
a corporate level even and when you're in a arms race you don't go slow and try to make sure you're
doing really the same thing and really you know test all the externalities you don't take the
risk seriously because um somebody is going to get there first and whoever gets there first has
all of the first mover advantage and so you'll deal with the problems later and so
this is actually why game theory matters so much is it is basically the only thing we have as the
currently at as what is guiding all of the technological development all of the major
geopolitical strategy is the a good choice is the choice that doesn't lose and doesn't lose means in
the very short term finite game even if it is destroying the playing field of the game for
everybody well that was brilliantly put and you you had my mind like going off in so many different
directions one one thing that i think sums this up so well is there a scene in drastic park the
first one where there's all these scientists working on creating dinosaurs and jeff goldbloom
comes in and he's not a scientist he's kind of a goofy guy and he's the only one that comes in and
says wait the question is should we do this you know they're all saying look what we can do look
what we can do and he's like but should we and they all look at him like he's crazy but it turns
out that that was a great question to ask yes and it came from the least scientific person there
which is a good showcase of human nature right there and yes i like what you said about how
when the game's ending everybody starts really going for self-interest because they they have to
but if the game never ends then it's about cooperation and i i think that you see this in
nature where like you'll see a giant shark and it's got these little fish eating bacteria off it
and that's a symbiotic relationship you also see it with like chimps or other animals that groom
each other you know there's really no benefit to yourself for grooming somebody else but
if you cooperate with them if you groom them they might groom you and it's like this cooperation
relationship um that i think benefits everybody so that you reminded me of that and i love what
you said about how science is what is and religion is kind of runs the domain of what ought because
i think that really speaks to both the issues in those fields like science in the realm of facts
science reign supreme but they really struggle with coming up with morals and ethics and principles
whereas in the realm of religion oftentimes we make fun of them for getting their facts so wrong
but in other realms you know they really have it right and that's why religion's been around
for so many thousands of years because it it seems like it might be factually incorrect but it's
metaphorically correct and yeah yeah and i wouldn't even say that um science says what is
is science can explore what is exclusively in the domain of the objective not the subjective
not the intersubjective and specifically in the domain of the subset of the objective things
that are measurable which is not everything and repeatedly measurable and yet still it is only
going to tell us as much as those very small number of things we've measured so far and if i'm
if i'm observing or measuring anything there might be a nearly infinite number of things
i could observe about it right if i'm trying to study the body there's a lot of things happening
in the body which ones do we study and so if i get a measurement and now i say this thing is
happening that's not how the body works that's how that tiny little molecular target works
how does the body work we continue to discover almost every day a whole new domain of
types of molecules types of systems that we didn't even know about before
and so science can tell us only in the domain of the objective only in very limited context some
things about what is and so there's a humility to recognizing that and obviously it's still
powerful enough that we can land a rover on mars using that and we can split the nucleus of an atom
and we can edit the genome and make new species and we can make a large hadron collider that
has pulses that are hotter than the surface of the sun and so it's extraordinarily powerful for some
things but the insights that have been offered about anything in the domain of meaning
are actually at best inferences from some things that the mostly the domains of science that are
focused on the limitations of science tell us right things like complexity science things like
uh deep ecology that are looking at what the limits of reduction of science were and the
way you have to look at not just to understand a thing you have to understand its parts but
to understand a thing you have to understand what it's a part of that contextualizes it makes it that
way yes you're reminding me uh for many years i worked at a psych institute that was part of a
medical school and psychiatry was kind of seen as the ugly cousin within the medical school because
it wasn't as objective and i remember there was a big insecurity in the psych institute because
they wanted to be a hard science so they really leaned into like neuroscience and neurotransmitters
and they they tried to say that mental health issues were a chemical imbalance that's where
we got that idea and that if you're sad it's just because your your mechanics are off and here we
just add a little bit more chemicals here and that'll fix you right up and i think that got us into
a lot of trouble yeah um if i say that you're sad because you have some mysterious biochemical
deficiency we don't say why we don't ask if it has anything to do with your diet or your exercise
or lifestyle or anything like that first we assume that it's the physical body being off
because that's what we study is the physical objective world nothing about the field of your
relationships or your sense of meaning or unresolved trauma or anything else um
and then we so we first assume the mind issues from the body then we assume the body is just
wrong for some reason that we don't know and that an external chemical solution is the answer
and uh specifically a patentable one where we will be able to charge the price that we need to
make back the r&d money we had to put in to get through phase three clinical trials
and so from a market perspective this is actually really important if
to make it through a phase three clinical trial to get fda approval to treat disease
with the thing costs a lot of money costs like i have half a billion dollars and to be able to
make that money back if the thing that we studied if the market is paying for it if the thing that
we studied now everybody can sell at the same cost as me i'll never be able to get the r&d
back nobody will fund the r&d so i have to be able to patent the molecule such that i can charge
enough to get the r&d money back to patent the molecule i can't patent things that were part of
your body when it was healthy so i have to look at synthetic molecules that we invent
which means that nowhere in medicine when when we're looking for synthetic molecules are we
studying how a healthy person works or are we studying you when you were healthy before this
thing started or are we studying molecules that were even part of the evolutionary environment
of people we're studying synthetic molecules that weren't part of any healthy person and weren't
part of any evolutionary environment like what's the chance that that's the right way to promote
health it's just wacky right but if we are really trying to study health we're going to find a bunch
of things that we cannot patent and we can't profit off of anywhere near as well and so this
is the example of when you're asking should we do that and what are the odds that guide how should
we go about studying it the perverse incentives built into the market built into not just the
market but the combination between the market the worldview of reductionism the regulatory
processes that are all self-reinforcing has that be the approach and this is why of course despite
all the years of psychiatry and psychiatric medicine mental illness continues to rise
self-harm continues to rise suicidal ideation and suicide continues to rise despite all of the
work in kind of healthcare and pharmaceuticals and the fact that like healthcare is the number one
area of spending for our government and deficit spending and etc obesity continues to rise and
also whole bunches of new autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases and cancers as well
as psychiatric diseases that the curve of the rise of those diseases matches very closely to the
curve of the amount of chemical pollution we put into the environment and agriculture and industry
the american chemical society journal lists 230 million known chemicals and
ever since the environmental movement with silent spring started in the 60s recognizing how
dangerous pesticides were and that they were extincting species and having huge effects
despite all the activity of the environmental movement we've put more total pesticides into
the atmosphere every single year than the previous year and pesticides herbicides etc and you look
at the curve of the rate of like inventing things that are designed to kill the foundation of life
and the foundation of ecosystems with which we co-evolved and spraying them onto the food
supply and into the atmosphere at scale like that's a good idea and and then so if we want to
solve cancer right now that's one of the arguments as to why we need to rush forward with AI so we
can use AI to be able to do genetic engineering immuno oncology to solve these cancers and if you
want to slow down the tech you're a terrible person because look at this little girl with cancer and
would you want her to die but that same technology that gets advanced for that purpose now is cheap
and easy to use for all market purposes and so now you get the bio weapons that it creates
and you get the weird designer babies and the you know all the things all the things the AI technology
does and why is it that the energy doesn't go first to looking at why the cancer rate is raising
everywhere and how to get rid of that which is like mostly an issue of things like chemical
pollution and how we do agriculture yikes so you're you're laying out a story of a lot of things
going wrong but i've heard you talk about this progress narrative and it you know i've there's
there's people like steven pinker who are saying everything's getting better um infant
mortalities way down people's lifespans are longer um the gdp of countries is bigger people are
becoming richer globally is that is that progress narrative is that completely false
it's not completely false it's just mostly false um those stats are largely true as cherry picked
decontextualized stats so the progress narrative is the the idea that everything is getting better
and better through some combination of science technology markets democracy and things like
that that's kind of the version of it in modernity um and there is a regressive history that goes with
it right a habsian view that the state of man in nature right the indigenous people had lives that
were rude is short nasty and mean and that's our you know comparison um this view definitely became
like the dominant worldview in modernity especially because when you do the isot distinction and then
science is the thing that keeps giving you better and better weapons that win war and better and
better ability to increase food supply and grow markets and power and all like that and the other
area is mostly binding and asking you should you do this then of course you this is where you get
niches god is dead because you you know you that's not conferring the advantage anymore and the worldviews
that confer the behaviors that win in war and win in markets are the ones that make it through
and it was a really important point i'll go back to for a moment when you're asking again is a human
nature became theoretic um when throughout history there have been times where they were much more
peaceful cultures and then warring cultures and the warring cultures killed the peaceful cultures
took whatever elements they had turned them into weaponized capabilities and continued on
and when you really study the history of that and you know we can see that in relatively recent time
of like was Tibet a perfect culture before Mao invaded no but were they pretty lovely in a lot
of ways relatively yes were they good at building standing armies not really because the worldview
they had didn't orient itself to that and what happened to them was part of history everybody
knows and the same was true with Native Americans and colonization it's just most people don't if
they haven't studied it don't know the extent of these things the Americas had about 140 million
human beings living here before colonization and the effects of colonization killed 90% of them
and that's a loss of so many ancient languages and systems of music and prayer and medicine
and spirituality and etc if you ask the Native Americans what do they think of the progress
narrative like they they can't believe that anyone would actually believe that seriously
if you ask even if you ask most black people particularly ones who are American descendants
of slaves what do you think of the progress narrative they just don't have the same view on it
obviously right and if you um if you were to ask all of the species that we make extinct and you
know roughly there's somewhere between 10 and 30 species made extinct by human activity every day
how how what they think of the progress narrative or if you ask all the animals in factory farms
it's so obvious that we're talking about progress for a very small number of beings
but let's go back to and a very narrow definition of progress at the expense of
lots of other beings let's go back to this idea of um warring cultures and peaceful cultures
so if you look at the history of the Attila the Huns and Genghis Khans and having the
Terribles and Caesars and Alexander the Great and etc and Maus and Stalin and Leopold's going into
Congo it's a it's a crazy history of humanity Genghis Khan by himself is estimated to have
killed 50 million people in his life him and his people while he was alive not the empire
afterwards just in his life 50 million people which was roughly 11 percent of the entire global
population at the time yes i and that was on horseback i i just read that one in 200 people on
earth are his descendant direct descendant yes yeah it's estimated that somewhere between
eight and 11 percent of Asians are his descendants and so that's because in addition to all the
killing they did a lot of raping and that does mean that the cultures that did not mount as
effective militaries didn't make it through and the cultures that did mount those their ideas their
cultures their etc are what made it through and this is part of that multipolar trap of history
now in general the when king Leopold was going over to the Congo and doing some of the most
atrocious enslavement and murder of the people of the Congo ever to take all their stuff he was
doing it under the guise of it being a humanitarian mission to help the people of Africa and similarly
read all of the quotes about how we were like manifest destiny that it was kind of like
god's ordained divine right for us to take over the united states north america etc and that
it was a generous act that we were civilizing the savages the extent of human motivated reasoning
is really profound the extent to which we believe and try to convince people to believe things that
are directly in our self-interest that are totally ridiculous and somewhere else i want to go that
well yeah you just reminded me of a quote the the worst atrocities are always committed
in the name of virtue you know if you go throughout history at look at Mao and Stalin and Hitler
i mean they all have slogans that say oh we're doing this for the common good you know we're
doing this to help you and they were completely blind i don't think they were completely blind
but they they thought that they were doing good and often the most narcissistic evil person
thinks that their plan for the world is going to create this utopia but really it's they're
ignoring all the mass suffering that they're causing on the way to get it's not necessarily that they
think that it's going to cause utopia it's that they know that is the effective propaganda to
mobilize the people and so yeah this was the thing i wanted to say is
the winner gets to write history and the winner doesn't usually write the history that they were
the bad guys who defected on their agreements with the other side and lied more effectively took
advantage and did the raping pillaging murdering they tell the story that them winning the war was
progress right that the that alexander was uniting all of these disparate tribes and
bringing the world together the genghis was uniting the mongols into you know a great empire that
so the history being written by the winners also leads to a progress narrative and the
wiping out of all the alternative histories of what the cost of that progress was the cost of
that progress was so much of their own culture couldn't be invested in art and spirituality
and child rearing it had to be invested in military activity and conquest and now market
dominance and things like that and the other peoples had to be destroyed and so
the root of the progress narrative is really
in history being written by the winners and in kind of uh at least that's a big part of the story
and then of course in modernity there was a divorcing of the idea that there was much value
in tradition and new insights were particularly going to be how we move forward and so then that
became the dominant narrative rather than embedded within religious narratives
yeah i think a lot of the progress narrative comes down to just do we have more stuff today
are we more comfortable i think that we're so comfortable today that if you asked anybody
would you prefer to live 50 years ago or 100 years ago i i doubt anybody would want to trade
places like it seems nobody with the iphone 15 is going to go back to the iphone one you know
we're just marching forward and so we think the iphone 15 is better than the iphone one
and i think possibly just having more stuff more material that materialist mindset is also
contributing to that progress narrative yeah because we are the people that are the conditioned
result of that thing and we don't know what the life before was like to know what how much we're
missing people who haven't spent a lot of time in deep wilderness
mostly don't know how much happier they would be if they were mostly don't know how many of their
pains and illnesses and psychological disorders would go away how much of the
striving is actually a result of emptiness from living in a environment in which we're
don't have intimate relationships with other people in nature
if you spend time with a indigenous culture and see how much more they understand the language
of all the animals most people aren't aware of how impoverished their life is that they
don't know how to communicate to the animals that they don't know what the whole world around
them is saying all the time and that their mind is never still and quiet and so it's hard to feel
bad about missing something you've never experienced and you don't know exists also when the addict is
coming down they don't want happiness they want a hit of the supply right if somebody's coming down
on heroin they don't want to see a beautiful sunset they don't want a deep conversation with a
friend they they everything else is meaningless because they have created a hypernormal stimuli
that allows them to only get happiness from a very narrow thing it's actually dead in their
ability to get happiness from lots of things and so there are reward circuits in us that are more
addictive there are other reward circuits that are not addictive that are more actually
in so the addictive reward circuit will give you a very quick spike and then it will drop you
and then you that makes a craving for another spike and obviously sugar does this and likes on
social media do this and using filters to look more beautiful than you are does this and etc
most of the things in our world do some version of this and then in the low then you crave more
of that thing and so you get of course more bipolar type experience but you also get an
erosion of your baseline over time you need there's less and less things that make you happy you
more and more need those stimulus and you need larger amounts of them the types of reward circuits
that lead to psychologically physiologically healthy people are ones that don't give you as much
spike as quickly but raise your baseline over time and so the type of reward you get from
exercising the type of reward you get from like meaningful conversation with friends from helping
somebody from time in nature you get reward circuits from those things but they're different
in kind than the reward circuits you get from fast food or from porn or from social media or
those other things but it's very hard to monetize those things on the supply side it's very hard
to sell you any of the things that on your deathbed you will say or what you wish you had spent all
of your time with every person on their deathbed says I wish I had spent more time with my family
and with my kids and with the people that I loved and telling them that I love them and working less
and pursuing things less and and none of the hits that they were spending their life pursuing are at
all meaningful in those reflections but because the supply side can basically market to the addictive
impulse better and it's important to understand that like from a business perspective especially
once you have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder profit you're like legally
bound to that as a director of public corporation one of the core goals is maximize the lifetime
revenue of a customer and addiction is awesome for lifetime revenue of a customer and so when
you look at the emergence of fast food and processed foods whether we're talking about
hostesses and twinkies or candies or coke or mcdonald's they're basically combinations of salt
fat and sugar different combinations of that with different texture profiles
that were actually scientifically optimized to maximize addiction there were lots of split
tests done to see which ones had the people crave them the most again and yet the reason that people
in an evolutionary environment the reason that things that had salt and fat and sugar gave people
more of a kind of dopamine hit was because in an evolutionary environment pre-agriculture
those things were very rare it was hard to get much of them and so if you got them there was an
incentive to go find the things that were evolutionarily rare and that were useful as soon as we make
them hyperabundance then people are dying of the excess of them we built a world we're not actually
genetically fit to and then exploit the weakness of that rather than try to support people to
navigate it well and but it's also that that those nutrients were bound with vitamins and
minerals and a lot of other nutrients simultaneously so the fast food removes all the micronutrients
optimizes those things optimizes addiction and so you can have people who are actually dying
of malnutrition while they're obese because they're so deficient in micronutrients
and so what fast food is to food where you just take the maximally addictive part and strip out
what why we're even attracted to it in an evolutionary environment strip out all of what's
good in it is also what social media relationships are to human relationships
is also what porn is to human intimacy is also what the news is to the desire to understand
the world you live in is what productivity is relative to meaning right stripping out a very
narrow aligned with the interest of the market hit that still has that same thing then you will
feel a need for greater and greater productivity and of course that is great from a GDP maximizing
perspective and not great from a deathbed reflections or the quality of how children
are raised or the quality of the environment perspective yeah that's a really strong point
there and it leads me to some dark thoughts where i'm thinking is our species going to select
for the people that can self-regulate meaning are the people that can't self-regulate who do
give into that porn addiction or the food addiction or all these addictions it seems
like they're just not going to pass their genes on it's like they're just the line ends there
and the people that can say no to those things are the ones now that are going to be able to find
romance and say no to all that porn and say no to all that sugary food the people that can
control their dopamine and their impulses are going to find each other and pass their genes on
it's like a filter
mostly not there's a few cases where what you're saying is true of course if someone is
has a level of drug addiction or food addiction that makes them so unfit for relationship that
they never get in relationship then sure that could be the case but
in general the selection criteria is largely going that has been going the other way you know
as we were mentioning with it was the mongol genes after the killing and raping that made it
through not the other ones and it's the populations it's the places that are willing to pump more
oil do more mining destroy the environment faster they can grow their populations faster
this is one of the classic examples is you know at the beginning of the industrial revolution
there were about a half a billion people 500 million people in the world
and that was after 10,000 years of civilization right roughly 13,000 from goblaki tepi how
whatever length you want to say and it was after two or 300,000 years of human beings
about a half a billion people and then in the last couple hundred years of the industrial
revolution we went from half a billion to eight billion like 200,000 years to get to half a
billion 200 years to go from half a billion to eight billion and in the industrial world in
the developed world what we call the developed world the resource consumption per capita winds
up about a hundred x during that time that doesn't mean you ate a hundred times more calories but
your life depends on a hundred times more calories to make the light bulbs and the internet and the
car and everything work in the form of fossil fuels and whatever that support all this so the
beyond just your body calories about a hundred x the resource consumption per capita and the
industrial revolution level at the beginning of that was already high relative to earlier times
so that's a what 1600 x increase in a unrenewable extraction from the environment and pollution
over a very short period of time
and corresponding with that we see that the population of wild animals the ones that aren't
extinct has gone down 70% globally everywhere during that they're just actually compared to 1900
and uh one of the most mind-blowing stats is when it comes to mammals only 4% of all the
mammals in the world are in the wild 95% of them are in factory farms so we have that many more
animals in factory farms in the entirety of the wild like to have a sense of how big our impact
on the world is so then there were many reasons that our population boomed in the industrial
revolution and this is all the progress story right look at how many more people there are and
all the things we have but the side of the progress story that isn't being told is just like
the victor's story and war is not telling the story of the other side or all of its
own soldiers that died or etc um the progress narrative post industrialization is not telling
the story of the animals in the factory farm or the extincted species or the rising turbo
cancers and autoimmune diseases and things like that um but the main technology that increased
the population was the green revolution hobberbosh and the development of synthetic fertilizers
and it allowed us to take a bunch of soil that wasn't arable and spray a fertilizer on it that
would grow crops so that you could grow a lot more crops in a lot more areas and that was
starting with the beginning of nitrogen the ability to create synthetic nitrogen
and then we ended up adding two more things to that the phosphorus and potassium so that's called
NPK people probably heard about NPK fertilizer so that supported this massive population boom
but it also supported being able to turn lots of forests that wouldn't have been worth cutting
down because the soil wouldn't have been that arable and lots of meadows and lots of other
places into agriculture land for people the NPK as it sprayed on the soil as opposed to compost
going back in the soil is only putting back those three minerals not the 72 minerals not all the
organic matter not everything else which can grow a plant that is very micronutrient deficient in
comparison which almost all the plants we get it's the it's the runoff of that into the river
into the ocean that causes all the dead zones in the ocean so at the beginning of hobberbosh there
were no dead zones in the ocean it's a three-quarter water planet the animals live in the ocean life
started in the oceans there's over 500 dead zones around the world massive areas of ocean where nothing
can live that are the result of that runoff the microbiome of the soil is destroyed when that's
put in which affects the genetics of the plant and the nutrient uptake which affects our genetics
when we take it or our genetic expression at least and so again that it's like one of the greatest
stories in the progress narrative that we got this method allowed us to get all these people
but if you look at the total set of harms that have come associated with that you're like
was that the best way to do it uh should we have tried to maximize the number of people
and um and how much were we decreasing the quality of life the authentic quality of life so
you know as the longevity went up mostly because of infant mortality going down
the morbidity in many ways has also been going up so yes there are people who are making it to 80
but they're on on average on 11 different prescription meds some of those are the side
effects of the other meds they're on they cause a really not awesome quality of life in lots of
ways as well as the externalized cost of the not awesome quality of life for everyone else
when you look at the fact that those curves whether it's pollution in the environment or
species extinction or any of the things are on still exponential curves crossing planetary
boundaries we don't get to keep doing this thing very long so our idea of progress has come from a
very narrow method of defining right our idea of progress is we define this problem in the super
narrow way can we grow more food not is it good quality food not will it not destroy the environment
you know just can we grow more food which from a the market perspective being able to sell it
obviously made sense um can we sell food that people buy more of doesn't matter we're not asking
don't do obesity and help people's health but Twinkie's totally up to that particular thing
so the progress narrative focuses on narrow areas of progress without looking at all the
externalized costs of that and so you can't really consider that I think that's a ridiculous
definition of progress it's a very immature at best generously and immature if not actually just
propaganda um for it to really be progress it doesn't just mean advancement and technology the
level of is it has to also be ought that it's actually better like more good which the philosophy
of science isn't enough to tell us and you can't put into metrics because you can't measure it so
it requires a different relationship to how we make choices what for for us to be having
authentic progress it means the world is actually becoming a better place so for that we have to
say better for whom is it better for everybody including the other species that we inhabit with
and what is our definition of good is it becoming better in the definition of
people's deathbed reflections are noticing a life full of much more meaning or is it becoming
like you know when you look at GDP as a metric obviously war drives GDP to go up
and addiction drives GDP to go up and sickness that's treated with medicine that could
that could have been prevented causes GDP to go up and so is GDP a good measure
like it's a ridiculous measure obviously and so
for us to and you know we said that the finite game you win when and it ends and we're definitely
on a path where the continuation of our win orientation will actually end
the possibility of civilization continuing on this planet to not have that happen we actually
have to redefine and really rethink about progress meaning factoring all the externalities is this
still good should we do this thing right the factoring the total set of things no ability to
privatize gain and socialize loss really saying factoring the whole set of things is this good
thing to do and rather than be bound in multipolar traps find a post game theoretic relationship to
if it is not actually progress for everybody then it's not going to be progress for anyone
because it's just going to drive arms races you get a momentary uptick in your security that
makes others insecure so they reverse engineer the thing and scale it up and the wars just become
more dangerous one area that i've paid close attention to is the birth rate and the population
is not growing anymore like it was it's looking like we're going to peak in about 2100 and already
countries like japan and korea are they're going way down they're losing exponentially more people
every year yeah and so we're still our population still going up it's going to go up for another
couple decades but we are plateauing is this kind of a natural course correction you think
um i think that's a fair way to see it the decreasing birth rate is partly
cultural but it's also largely physiologic right it's partly cultural in that when specifically
women have more education and economic opportunity they usually don't choose to have as many kids
and so that's a part of the story but a huge one one of the kind of morbidity increasing things
is decrease in fertility and the decreasing fertility throughout the whole developed world
does again correspond pretty closely to things like the rise of glyphosate use the rise of
pesticide use and other things that are debasing the physiology and you know its capacity to
reproduce healthfully so is that a corrective populations a very complicated topic you know
you'll hear people like peter zion talk about demographic collapse is one of the most serious
issues that we're facing um it's true that if we have lower population it will cause massive
problems to our world system because if you have less young people coming into workforce and you
have more old people that can't work but our need retirement accounts the economics of the system
starts to become really tricky the other side of the population story is that
before the plow in the beginning of us starting to clear cut whole areas
there were only like 30 to 50 million people and before the industrial revolution in the
capacity for industrial scale extraction faster than the regeneration of the resources there were
only 500 million people and that the curve of human population in the curve of other animal
extinctions map pretty close to one to one and so we've built a human system right a market
geopolitical kind of human system that was predicated upon exponential population growth
which obviously couldn't happen forever it was predicated upon exponential economic growth because
you have to have exponential economic growth of this financial system to just even keep up with
interest because next year there have to be all the dollars there are this year globally plus interest
and that and since the interest is on a compounding curve that means an exponential
demand for capital growth and since that capital to not be debased has to relate to
goods and services that also means an exponential demand for energy use there's a 99
correlation between global GDP and global energy use and also material use which is why the GDP
curve and the material extraction curve and energy use curve are nearly identical in shape
obviously on a finite planet you don't get to do that forever and yet every bit of how our system
works requires that because it was built upon a situation in which that growth curve was happening
and yet it was fundamentally incompatible with the biosphere so we have a situation now where
our civilizational system and the biosphere are incompatible with each other we can't change the
laws of physics of how the biosphere works so if we continue this thing as long as we can
and try to continue it we will end up destroying the biosphere that we depend upon
and to not destroy the biosphere we actually cannot maintain the fundamental logics of this system
you cannot continue exponential GDP growth can't continue exponential population growth
that means you're going to get demographic inversion for a while before you find
stable state type populations and these are some of the unprecedented challenges that we face currently
hmm yeah it's almost like our our biology is rejecting our species at the moment
um i was just our biology is what our biology is because we're so many people are now in fertile
the sperm count is plummeting miscarriages or skyrocketing even things like erectile dysfunction
is off the charts many young men are having trouble and it's almost like our biology is saying all
right i'm going to press the off switch you may want to pass your genes on but we're going to say
we're going to put this to a halt just for the sake of the earth but i'm wondering is the planet
really the boundary like if the population gets so big it puts pressure on us to go outward into
the cosmos we then have to extract off of asteroids and things like that is that
are we going to be forced to do that well that's obviously uh one of the dominant stories and
focuses right now is um we are using up all the resources of this planet turning them into
trash and pollution and rather than figure out how to solve that let's just extend that to the
rest of the universe um i think that that's one of the most kind of gross worldviews like so not
beautiful um uh i also think there's no chance that will happen just uh kind of in terms of the
scientific technological curves the time scales at which we destroy this are so much
sooner than the time scales at which we become really effectively interplanetary at the current
rates and so uh whether we are to become interplanetary in the future or not if that
is to be a possibility i think the only chance of that being viable is based on uh getting the
dynamics here right first obviously the you know there's a lot of energy that is going into
us mining asteroids and mining the moon and becoming a interplanetary species
yes i would totally love to see that energy reinvested in creating a viable civilization here
instead the other escape route is uh test realism right is uh AI and programmable matter
and the singularity approach you are actually talking earlier about
is do we have a situation where older people are not actually very useful
to younger people because the rate of technological change in the world is so different in
in so far as if we had a culture that was developing wisdom one it might not
promote all of the technologies um and allow for all of the technologies
one thing that's very interesting is when you look at various definitions of wisdom
they almost always involve the concept of restraint what not to do and which is not a
thing that is really a concept in our market or definitely in all the game theoretic scenarios
so if if we had a culture that was emphasizing wisdom
even if the technological environment changed there's a lot about wisdom that is trans contextual
that would still be transferable we didn't do that but we're also in a situation where the
technological singularity the rate at which technology is increasing is such that even young people
can't keep up with the rate of it and so Kurzweil's idea of the singularity the rate at which
technological change is so fast that by the time you're adapting to a new technological change
it has already been obsolete and the new technologies that are the most dominant
are coming out faster than humans can adapt so humans are no longer adaptive in the
technosphere the rate of information creation is such that no one can be an expert on anything
because there's more information being created than anyone can know in some ways we've already
passed the information and technological singularity and so the answer that uh
unfortunately most of the money of the world is following right now is accelerationism
is we're in this multipolar trap we can't stop it so the only thing that could possibly
we're not smart enough to understand all that and to adapt fast enough so maybe an AI will be
so whoever builds the first AGI is going to be what runs everything maybe whoever is the one
that builds it either because they can do a brain computer interface or they can do a whole brain
emulation upload of their consciousness to the cloud or because they can keep the AI working
for them or something they will have that kind of first mover advantage and so if you look at
you know Microsoft is a three trillion dollar company which is amazing right that means that
their market cap is more than the GDP of almost every nation in the world and if you look at the
top like 11 companies right now seven of them are basically have AI as their main play and
so you have all these trillions that are invested in the U.S. have to be the Chinese
at AI supremacy and the Chinese have to be the U.S. the various companies are all competing for
AI supremacy and it's and you'll see Sam Altman make jokes like oh it'll probably kill everybody
but it'll make a lot of shareholder profit in the meantime like openly make those jokes and there's
this weird world we live in where people are like okay let's just keep kind of going with that and
so the other answer to this that is being pursued that I think is even crazier than all right so
we destroyed this planet let's get off and get the other planets is let's create a digital god
that can solve all the problems and even if our creation of it risks absolutely everything
and is driving all the problems to be worse in the process
oh boy
it seems like these problems and these issues are so large that myself and the average person
it's just like it's too big for us to even wrap our minds around so we might as well just keep
living keep following our impulses you know like how do you get people to care about these
massive existential crises when their own personal problems are so much more urgent and real
they're not a few years ago the people in Kiev thought their normal day-to-day issues were
the most critical thing that obviously changed for them very rapidly
Kiev was a very progressive city people a lot of people in the blockchain community were moving
there because it was one of the places that was like a hub for decentralized computing
we and you know Israel was one of the most kind of technologically economically advanced places
and we see the dynamics that are happening there collapse can start to come to a place
it's so easy if we're not in the place where collapse is happening
to think that it won't ever happen because we don't have an experience of it so we don't have
an intuition for it even though the history is that every empire in the history of the world
collapsed that right before it collapsed it was usually at a tight that the people at that time
didn't think it was going to happen so they weren't doing any smart kind of guidance or
preparation they were continuing to live in the way that advanced what caused it to collapse
directly so we can be more foresightful than that it would be nice if we were more
foresightful than that and i'm saying that the timelines of the issues facing the world are
such that if people are paying attention right now they will realize there are things that are
much bigger issues than the things you're dealing with in your current life that are impending
that orient really deep life reconsideration the next thing is this is if if people haven't
everybody should go study the ash conformity studies in the milgram experiments which
you know i'll just recap very briefly milgram experiments fascinating behavioral psych done
at stanford where people were brought into the part of a scientific experiment they were told
that the experiment had to do with the effects of like electroshock therapy on people there's a
person on the other side of the wall who was going to be receiving a shock they just had to push the
button of the level of shock the scientist was monitoring and the what they were trying to do
is understand the effect of electric shock the reality was the person pushing the button was
the test case the person on the other side of the wall that they couldn't see he wasn't actually
hooked to electric shock they were an actor and every time the button was pushed they you know made
a noise accordingly but the people in the study obviously didn't know that that's why the study
worked and so the scientist the authority in the situation said okay go ahead and do the shock at
this voltage and the they'd hear on the other side a groan and then they turn the voltage up and
say now do it and then turn the voltage up and the person screams on the other side and the person
who's pushing the button is like is this okay are they all right over there and the scientist
like yes everything is okay this is what we have to do is for science and a humongous percentage
of the people continued to push the button because the authority told them to to the point that they
actually believed it was killing the person on the other side and the ash conformity studies are
where a whole group of people were all tested together about which line is longer and they'd
put a few lines or which color is darker or something like that and everybody in the group
was an actor except one but the that one person didn't know that they thought everyone else was
part of the study everyone else said this line is longer but it was obviously false right like
the other line was longer and a very high percentage of people
had their answer match with what the group said some people had their answer go against what the
group said even when the group said the right thing because they were disagreeable so rather than
actually observe reality themselves a lot of people either went with the group or disagreed
with it as the basis of their action but went with it was particular interest so going with
what the authority dynamic is going with what the kind of group dynamic is
so when the Nazis were being tried in the Nuremberg trials for war crimes this was one
of the most fascinating things because like how when we were talking about population wide
dispositions the Germans were not always genocidal people right and so it's like how did
it happen that relatively quickly a population of people who were moral human beings who loved
their children who you know were normal normal people were now at mass throwing kids in gas chambers
and when when they were asked did you believe that everything you were doing was good
90% of the Nazis said no they said at first we did but we were just bringing the people to the
camps who weren't going to exterminate them and etc and it got worse and worse and worse
and by the end like no we didn't think it was good and then they were asked did you try to stop and
all of them said no we didn't try to stop and when asked why they all quoted the same German
phrases that translate to officers orders I didn't really have a choice when people don't
feel like they have a choice they can be complicit with evil even if they are not actually evil
when people say there's nothing I can do about the world situation it's the same thing but rather
than the Nazis it's the distributed system that they're being complicit with all right well I'll
just keep doing all the things that the system is disposing me to do buying all of the things that
I want on Amazon having them delivered to my door and pursuing the cultural status things
that marketing tells me to pursue and etc rather than unplug from that thing and say the Christian
emergency quote that it's not a good measure of mental health to be well adjusted to a profoundly
insane society if my society is causing the extinction of 10 to 30 species every day
if it is increasing the chemical pollution to the point that everybody's becoming infertile and
having autoimmune diseases and cancers and neurodegenerative diseases if it is rapidly
building the most horrifying kinds of weapons possible in arms races is that a sane society no
it's a fucking batch hit crazy society do I want to be complicit with it am I willing to be complicit
with it am I willing to have my spot in the history of the world be at the time when human choice
mattered more than any other time because previously you could have the fall of a roman civilization
or the fall of the ottoman or the fall of the egyptian vast civilizations but it still wasn't
everything they were still local civilizations and you did have civilizations that actually fell
because of environmental overreach that was actually quite common and the over stripping the
environment in your civilization failing is a multi thousand year old story so you can read books
like the collapse of complex civilization by joseph tainter to show one of the reason civilizations
collapsed they cut down all of the trees the topsoil would erode they would lose agricultural
capability and then they'd stop being able to feed the people so we've been you know iceland used
to be covered in trees there's no trees the vikings destroyed all the trees the thing that we think
of as iceland is not iceland it's iceland post deforestation um some of the great deserts of the
world were the results of early human activity that desertified them and so but when we destroyed
the environment it was always just a local environment it wasn't the biosphere right it wasn't
the chemistry of the oceans writ large the atmosphere the amount of genetic integrity of
how many species of soil microbes there are things like that there's a study that came out
about six months ago on PFOS the fluorinated surfactants which are basically like you know
rain ex and scotch guard and the stuff that we spray on everything
that PFOS is found in rain water everywhere in the world it was found in freshly fallen snow
and Antarctica it's found in rain water on every continent that means there's just there's just one
category of pollution that we have made so ubiquitous that if you're off-grid collecting
rain water to try to not be part of the system it's filled with PFOS and it was at
PFOS that was at many times higher than the EPA allowable levels everywhere in the entire world
that's having biological effects not just on humans the infertility things but on the soil
microbes on the algae on the on everything right on the whole planet so if you see that we're at a
time where we could that the the precedent of history is its civilizations end and they end
for reasons that they helped cause they end for reasons that had to do with self-termination
and even if you say well they were beat by someone else usually it was also that they
engaged in rivalry that engendered those types of dynamics with the other people and oftentimes
they got large enough that they got internally infighting and erosion of how their government
worked because of corruption and things like that many of the civilizations that fell to an
opponent fell to opponents smaller than ones that they had successfully defeated earlier because
they had already went through internal decay so the precedent is civilizations end they play
their own growth plays a major role in their own end but for the first time in history we have a
single global civilization where all of the products we depend on take six continent supply
chains to make there is no chinese civilization and us civilization and all the us stuff depends on
chinese stuff depends on cobalt that comes from the drc in africa depends upon oil that comes from
the middle east come you know etc and so all the manufacturing of our needs comes from a global
civilization that is in the same process of self-termination it doesn't have to go that way
we could go a different way with it you can imagine that none of the nazis wanted to defect
because if they defected the idea was they would be killed right if they could coordinate and all
defect then there wouldn't have been the genocide in the first place the ability for people today
to realize that the trajectory of the world that we're on is not the trajectory that they want
that they are not willing to be complicit with that the possibility of changing it is a more
potent possibility for meaningful contribution than anyone has ever had in terms of scale
and that that's a more worthy use of their life and attention than whatever is currently engaging in
that i think is the only sane assessment
i love everything you just said and i'm i'm wondering is this a privileged world view though
like it's hard to go to somebody in a developing nation who's burning fossil fuels just to stay
warm or you know they're it's it's hard to go there and say hey just stop fishing you're over
fishing here when they're start they're just trying to survive you know we've built our civilization
up to a point where we don't have to we're not living in that survival mindset um Jordan Peterson
his theory is that you got to make everybody rich and then they start to care about the environment
what do you think about that idea um
indigenous people who
didn't use didn't even have fiat systems of money all cared about the environment
so like that's a um there's so many of our thoughts on sociology that are looking at
ubiquitous conditioning post industrialization and because it's ubiquitous conditioning certain
dominant systems one then we do all of our social studies on these people that were conditioned
this way and then we call it human nature and if we were to look at indigenous people that were
of course how everybody was for all of human history and there's a lot of variants in it
they fall outside of all of the sociological bell curves but we just call those statistical
outliers are so do you have to be rich to care about the environment no is it harder to care if
you are in abject poverty yes indigenous cultures weren't in abject poverty they didn't have a lot
of surplus but they had a relationship with a they were able to provide for themselves in
relationship with nature in a way that was sustainable poverty is actually a result of
the thing we call civilization that's actually a really important point is when you
start to create large cities right Sumeria Babylonia Egypt etc the early empires
now you have a scenario where people are being trained in specialist activities so that you get
division of labor and more total things happening so people have are all dependent upon this overall
system and no one has self-sufficiency or even small scale like tribal sufficiency
and that system is in a process of unrenewable unsustainable growth and game
theoretic dynamics with other places and so you know before colonization Africa was not a place
of rampant poverty right Africa was a place of rampant poverty after colonization after
destroying the people's cultures kind of enslavement environmental damage moving people from the
arable land they were in you know so many things like that and so it's so that logic itself is
actually part of the perpetuation of the existing system that says okay you have to have everybody
grow up in in the economics of this system well if you tried to give everyone in India
and Bangladesh and China and Nigeria a US or UK quality of life in terms of resource consumption
per capita you there is no way to do that we are already past ecological tipping points
with already that not being the case and so I'm not putting the burden of thinking about
how to change the world system on the people who were put into poverty by the world system
most of your listeners are probably not in this place many of your listeners might feel that
they're working hard to pay the bills but they also probably when they get a chance increase
their cost of living um in a way and you know continue to increase their cost of living as
they're capable of producing more such that their time stays bound to uh you know money making and
such that they continue to feel that they have to work and be part of the system all the time
but you know one of the gifts in my life was I don't know I think some mentors told me this
early was I kept my cost of living extremely low such that I kept the amount of my time allocated
to supporting my existence very low so I got to have most of my time allocated to studying the
world that I was in and thinking about what was meaningful and engaging in it in a way that was
not um market bound I want to say something about progress yes yes
if you think about
human life depending upon
all of these species and this biosphere and these this ecosystem that took
kind of billions of years of evolution
the amount of work that nature put into creating a world that we can exist in
is mind-blowing right like the amount of if you want to call evolution the amount of like
design and iteration and work that had to happen to get a world that we can exist in is mind-blowing
it's reasonable that a huge percentage of our attention would go to maintaining and protecting
that as opposed to just the topic of advance if advancement is much more interesting than maintenance
advancement is much more interesting to egos in particular
to uh you know the things that we get to take credit for very few people make the history of
book for maintaining the world um but most of life should actually be about maintenance
and you look at the I mean this is a key part of the division of labor between men and women is that
in householding feeding the kids you wash the dishes and they get dirtied and then you wash
them and then they get dirtied and you make food and then it gets eaten and you make food and it gets
eaten and so you don't actually get to make the history books for that and yet it's the foundation
of everything and um so I think a huge part of a healthy culture puts an incredible value on
maintaining and stewarding the unbelievable gift that existence is and realizing that it takes
work to maintain and steward and so progress is actually not the main focus the main focus is
actually appreciation of what is and honoring and relating to what is well maintenance on the
doing side is a huge amount of the activity obviously all the examples we're giving where we
made progress that caused harm other places is not doing that right it's causing radical harm to
in a very small number of years and decades to what took nature billions of years to make
and when we make a species extinct that was the result of billions of years of evolution
we make them extinct quickly and we can't ever get them back and if we destroy a culture where
their language took thousands of years to evolve and they're you know then they're gone forever it's
it takes a long time it takes decades to grow an adult human being but you can kill them in
a second destruction is fast um and as a result maintenance and protection should be a very high
value because you can also grow things fast that are also destroying other things that are outside
of the field of where your market incentive or what your you know purview of your jurisdiction what
you're supposed to be focused on is it's not just market incentive it's I remember one of the first
times I started engaging with kind of government organizations my very early 20s talking to people
the world food program about how to solve world hunger and they had an approach that brought NPK
based agriculture to the developing world and did a whole lot more agriculture in those places so
that you didn't just have to ship food to them and I said that approach will accelerate the dead
zones in the oceans very rapidly which will accelerate the uninhabitability of the entire
planet and they said that's right I guess that's true we hadn't thought of that but ultimately
oceans are not the metrics we're tasked with the metrics we're tasked with are how many people
were feeding per year right now and so like so it's not just the perverse incentive of the market
it's also the choice making architectures that divide the world into parts and think you can
optimize a part without thinking about its relationship to everything else in the universe
that's actually radically more interconnected than that the other thing is not only did this world
take so much to create that we want to maintain but also to just enjoy and appreciate a meaningful
human life has a lot of time just in awe of sunsets and trees and animals and children and stars and
and if the goal is to make stuff better to make stuff better to make stuff better to and it never
grounds in the actual experience of the beauty of what is who cares right so a huge percentage of
right life should not be oriented to progress but actually taking in and like all and gratitude
the beauty of what is so much of our progress impulses because we don't have that and so there's
an emptiness that wants to fill itself with the addictive hit of progress right I I'm getting ahead
I'm growing I'm getting better I'm inventing a new thing I'm you know whatever and a lot of the
progress impulse is pathological result of emptiness now there is a healthy type of progress
it's also important because taking in the world as it is that mode of being is the foundation
it's the foundation of why anything matters at all is because we actually have experience the depth
of our experience of the meaningfulness of life is why anything matters to then want to protect
maintain or add to but we are also created beings and we want our creation to add to the beauty of
the world so first we need we want to take in the beauty of the world we want to protect and
maintain it and then we want to add to it but where it really adds to it right add to meaning
that in harmony with all that is otherwise it's not going to add to it it's going to
you know add something and destroy other things and it may be destroying things that are more
fundamental and more meaningful and so it is important that we have a sense of progress
that comes from a depth of being and fullness so that we're not trying to get all of our
havingness from progress there's there's also so much about the way kids are raised
where them learning more is where they get their rewards and them you know gaining new
it's the combination of that with you know they're progressing in their studies as the main
place of where they get their reward with not enough depth of real intimacy and unconditional love
that creates a doing over being emphasis right another part of that that's so significant is that
in most kids growing up most of the times they were rewarded was for doing something somebody
else wanted them to do doing something that the teachers parents wanted them to do and getting
an answer other people had already figured out and most of the times they were punished or told
they were wrong were for answers that made sense to them or things that their own sensibility wanted
to do and so if you want to train ash conformity into everybody and you know mill room conformity
and everybody that's a good way to do it it's not a good way to train people how to actually think
how to discover and how to make good choices on their own where was i right before this i
wanted to come back we were talking about schooling and incentives and maintenance rather than
progress ah yes so if
marshal Rosenberg admitted non-mine communication with someone i got to study with and it's so
beautiful to watch him talk about how he worked with kids in how he taught kids he said when the
when i'm teaching kids say math and the kid gets what we would call the right answer
i don't praise them for getting the right answer and i don't punish them for getting the wrong
answer we just talk about the right and wrong answers independent of their kind of sense of
validation so like a kid rushed to the front of the classroom as the first one finishing a
math assignment could tell that he rushed to the front of the classroom and was the fastest one
because his parents or whatever had been ingraining the you know you need to get all the right answers
and be the fastest at it and rather than say oh look you got them almost all right and one wrong
good job you got a 99% but then also the pain on the one wrong marshal looks at it and says
you know i get the same answer as you for all of these ones except this one i got a different
answer on this one can you walk me through how you got that one and the kid self corrected it
and said okay we got the same answer on all of these cool but then has a deep expression of the
love of the kid when he sees what they are like their authentic self expressing itself not just
them getting the right answer on things because then that kid might start to love math even though
they don't really love math just because they figured out how to get reward circuits on it
um so
the type of progress that comes from a sense of fullness of what is and desire to
appreciate protect maintain and add to what is is a much healthier one than the one that
comes from the desire to fill an emptiness then it is important that we can act that we actually
believe that we can have the activity of our life leave the world better for others
that's the authentic meaningful part of the progress narrative that i
i've got to experience a tremendous amount of beauty i want to leave the world at least
as beautiful not worse and ideally more beautiful for others and that's such an important sacred
impulse that i want to rescue that from the propagandized version that says because you
grew gdp or because you got a new product or market out there um you know a product to market
or because um you know some new piece of technology was advanced even if it's used to
destroy lots of things that that's progress it's the reality of what authentic progress would be
which is i actually left the world better better requires meaning we can say something about good
and ought not just is and better for whom a more inclusive definition that includes everybody
future generations not just my people but all people not just people but other beings
and a deeper definition of what is actually meaningful which is going to ground in the
basis of the depth of experience and so i want a world where people feel that they can add to
progress where there is something sacred about the way we think of progress and because it is so
sacred a bastardized version of it is totally not okay right the bastardized version of it
is a sin it's like no no the idea that we are unbelievably gifted to exist in this world at all
we want to honor and protect that and that we were endowed with creative capabilities we want
to use those creative capabilities to leave that kind of gift for others that i actually want
people to hold how sacred that that progress impulse is and make sure that all the ways they
add to the world actually meet that definition i know there's so many ways i want to go with
this conversation but i'm i'm curious to know how you came to these ideas we're like psychedelics
a part of your mind expansion or meditation like what what brought you to this way of thinking
i'm not trying to derail us on this conversation but it seems like there's a like a spiritual flavor
to some of the things and i'm wondering where that came from
many different things i'll say a few
one thing that was really a very fortunate experience when i was a kid
my mom took me to do a lot of activism work of many kinds and volunteer work and one
the types of volunteer work was we'd go to uh old folks homes and spend time with the people
there and just talk and listen to their stories and um and particularly we'd find people who didn't
have family members who were coming to visit and kind of adopt them as grandparents and visit them
often sometimes bring them over to the house and um and i i got to have the experience of being with
people who were literally on their deathbeds and shared their deathbed reflections many many many
times as a you know as a young kid and that was super impactful um because there were patterns
that the people shared that were very noticeable and they said roughly like
there's a way that i'm reflecting on what was meaningful now that death is eminent that i
never could before because before i was always still focused on the obligations of what i had to
do next and what i still wanted to do so i was not purely backwards looking and so i didn't go as
deep into that and as i don't have a chance to do any more things in the future and i'm just
reflecting on what was most meaningful you know their insights that come up and um
um you know there are lots of uh articles that say number one regret of the dying that
different people have um have said different things and it has a lot to do with the questions you
ask that frame them but as i as i was there listening the one that stood out the most by far
of the regret of the dying was that they didn't express their love to everyone around them enough
but they were like i you know i so wish i would have told my kids how much i love them how proud
of them i was i wish i'd have spent more time with them anyway you know i wish i'd have told my
parents more things and it was where they really hurt it was where they had remorse and pain
facing death and felt that they had lived wrong um the other thing was the second thing was that
the things that felt most important and meaningful to them they put off because of the things that
they felt like they had to do and that was the next biggest source of regret was that their life
didn't align with their own values as much as they wish it had and um so that was very impactful and
i never saw any of them say that they wished they had spent more time with their work and their
productivity i didn't see any of them say the highlight of their life was the things that
they bought um or their accomplishments actually the their highlight of their life was always moments
of uh love and intimacy in ways they had been able to do something meaningful for people and
things like that and so it was very striking how different their reflections on what mattered
were from how everyone continued to spend their whole life and what the market optimized for
and what the state optimized for and what education optimized for it was almost perfectly
optimized for life's full of regret so that was one thing uh i i did not want to make the exact
same mistakes that it was easy to see so many people had as the most fervent thing they could
offer to a young person was please don't make the same mistake i'm like okay i get it i get it um
um also being engaged in activism of other kinds i got to see a factory farm very young
and you know i grew up eating meat without thinking about where it came from while also
having dogs and cats and guinea pigs and loving animals and when i saw the condition of the animals
in the factory farm and that it's you know it was a animal Auschwitz it was a you know mind blowing
unnecessary continuous suffering um i you know i i stopped eating meat that day i started studying
everything that i could about factory farming and animal rights work and i was nine and that put me
into my first pretty like deep suicidal phase because like if someone was doing that to my
dog right if my dog was in that kind of tortured position like i would do anything to stop it
and this was billions of animals that were as sentient as my dog and i didn't know how to stop
it but i couldn't know that that was happening and just ignore it and focus on other things and feel
okay i was like i can stop thinking about them but they can't get out of being there they have no
way to get themselves out maybe since i'm not in there i can get them out it could have been just
as easy that i was born into that situation this consciousness or born as an into a child
soldier in Darfur situation i was born into this situation that is a blessing that i can take no
credit for but there's an obligation that comes with it and the obligation is maybe i can do something
and i realized that i couldn't kill myself because
i that didn't get any of the animals out that didn't you know save them
but i couldn't imagine like okay how do i live and just be normal to people in conversations
and talk about normal shit and be focused on whatever my own personal self-centered stuff is or
knowing that an infinity of torture is happening and be okay with it like i would have to dissociate
completely and that makes me a sociopath in a way and i i so i felt like there was no way
that i could just have a successful life that didn't require being a sociopath but i couldn't kill
myself and so the only answer was i have to infect reforms and so that got me engaged in
activism and then that showed me the overfishing of the oceans and that showed me the destruction of
the coral reefs and that showed me the deforestation and the destruction of you know all the things
and so it just kept expanding and the benefit of that is when you really see
the suffering in the world deeply enough and you take it in deeply enough
that it can never not be with you it's an antidote to the narcissism that is otherwise
ubiquitously conditioned in everybody to just be focused on me my desires my goals my problems
what do i need what how am i advancing myself my progress it's just such a horrible prison of a way
to be and yet in my house that people spend 90 of their time indoors separate from the natural
world separate from all other beings around filled with all the things that i wanted that
continuously are re-engaging the what do i want desire kind of ego a complex we're being like
those aspects of self are the ones that are being continuously developed in us even by just
where we are and i find that when i've got to take people into deep wilderness who hadn't
spent much time there and particularly if i get to take a few people where they get to have a really
authentic relationship with each other although there with no game theory no striving no social
status anything and they get to be in um deep nature i find that almost all of their addictive
tendencies drop quickly like pretty quickly they stop wanting to scroll their phone all the time
and most of the productive impulse also starts to drop and that is an unhealthy version of the
productive impulse it's the one that is actually trying to fill an emptiness trying to you know
be somebody it's a whatever be somebody get something but i also find that very quickly
everyone starts to when i ask them get much more at peace with death
in that environment because when you're looking around in nature there's no square foot that
doesn't have death in it there's decaying leaves there's a dead tree there's you know there's death
everywhere but there's life coming out of it and it's all beautiful and it's all interconnected
and there's no clear boundaries between the things because the moss growing on the trees and the
squirrels in it and the fungus on the roots and the and in that and the living in the nuclear
family home separate from everybody else and surrounded by the results of our own acquisition
is conditioning a very different part of self and so this is another interesting thing you know
i said that there's a lot of sociology that was conditioned that was looking at the condition
world and saying it's human nature if most indigenous people are not afraid of death
so you look at Ernest Beck's kind of terror management theory which is very useful in the
kind of civilized world civilized equal domesticated world and
because it's fair to think of the thing we call civilization as a domestication program for wild
sapiens wild sapiens were for hundreds of thousands of years and relatively small tribes
that the idea that everything we do is to avoid fear of death
well you can induce fear of death in people and then in make a world system that induces
more fear of death and then where their desire to avoid the fear of death has them contribute
to that world system but that is again not innate to all forms of human nature
so i got to spend a lot of time in nature when i was a kid
um and so just had a very deep love for the non-human world and uh then a really deep
feeling horrified at the destruction of it and and then yes there were plenty of experiences
in meditation and with uh when you could call psychedelics and with honestly also just being
alone in nature for long periods of time where the intrinsic beauty of every being becomes
forefront and became forefront in my awareness then the fact that every living thing is interconnected
to every other thing right like who am i without plants i couldn't exist without plants they produce
the oxygen that i need to live they produce the calories they you know everything so
and who would i be without bacteria i wouldn't exist who would i be without viruses i wouldn't
exist who would i be without plankton i wouldn't exist so i am an emergent property of all these
other life forms but when i think of myself without thinking of them i can actually advance
my own interests while destroying the things that i actually depend upon without which i don't
even exist i was talking to a friend the other day a new colleague whose work i think is brilliant
her name is venessa andriotti she wrote a book called hospicing modernity you should have her on
and uh indigenous woman and she said that her chief's definition of colonialism and i just
thought this was so beautiful uh was not taking other people's land was not um destruction of
land or land ownership or ownership of people or any of those things that those were all secondary
epiphenomenon that the essence of colonialism was believing that there are separable things
and that all of that other stuff arises out of that optimizing for some things at the expense
of others believing that they're separable and that that's grounded even in something deeper than
belief which is the being conditioned to perceive the world as a bunch of separate things which
happens even the way we teach kids language to name things as nouns there are no nouns right
call a tree it's a noun it's a incredibly dynamic process of billions of biochemical
interactions and biological interactions and physical interactions that give rise to that thing
it's a process right you are a process all the things that you think of as nouns are just
because you're not observing very well and that you think of as separate things could that
does that tree stop at the micro risio or at the you know like uh if you say what is outside of it
it doesn't exist without that all the way down to like is an atom a real thing one atom of hydrogen
well what is the atom without the Higgs field
doesn't exist what is the atom without the electromagnetic field what is the atom without
the strong force what is the so the atom depends upon so much that is not the atom and yet we
ignore that when we define the atom is this we take all the context for granted so then
everything that we care about we pretend is a separable thing and that we can advance it without
understanding all the things it's connected to and we harm the things it's connected to
in the process so both my study of ecology and my study of complexity and my study of
the philosophy of science brought me to this but yes they're also uh and study of history right
but also what you could call spiritual experiences that I think are just called like
clear perception perception that is not totally distorted in which the interconnectedness of
everything with everything else and the uniqueness of everything are both apparent
right that this tree in front of me is completely unique there's not one exactly like it this human
there's like you have experiences and perceptions and life experiences that nobody has ever had and
nobody ever will have exactly like you do and I could actually never know all of that fully
and so when you get that every being is totally unique that means that they're priceless
and and irreplaceable so you can't externalize harm anywhere and all interconnected also means
your fate and the fate of everything you care of is tied up with theirs
I think that you can call it spiritual I think it's scientifically true I think it's philosophically
true I think it's just uh and I think it is what naturally arises in perception
if the mind is not too heavily distorted
you reminded me of one of my favorite lessons from Ram Dass where he talks about how there's two
spiritual ideas that are in conflict with each other that we must hold in our heart at the same time
one is that suffering is endless and your heart has to break for all the suffering in the world
and at the same time you have to see that it's all perfect and those two are completely at odds with
each other but it's very important to be able to see things in both those lights at the same time
and so like oftentimes when people are on rough times I go to the I lean towards the it's all
perfect because I'm trying to show them that this is all part of some higher wisdom that's
training you for a greater purpose and it seems like what you're focused on heavily is the
endless suffering in the world and part of me wants to like zoom out and say hey is this all part
of some greater lesson like are we kind of just killing ourselves like all this um mistreatment
of the earth is really just gonna destroy ourselves you know like we like that quote that you said
earlier from the the chief he said we are not the strand we are the we are not the web we are the
strand in the web and so yeah anything we do to destroy the earth we're just doing to ourselves
anytime you mistreat somebody you're really just mistreating yourself you know hurt people hurt others
it is one of the really deep kind of paradox is to contemplate of the sense of order in the universe
and the kind of perfection in that and the sense of um injustice and atrocity and what is worth
changing and
I remember a time when I was maybe 25 and a woman asked me if I would talk with her daughter
who uh she had recently found out her um husband had been raping for years and her daughter was 15
and um asked if I you know talk with her see if I could help in any way and the
mom hadn't known when she did know she um you know threw the guy out and probably
prosecuted and was trying to help the daughter and in her desire to help the mom had a
you know some kind of new age you could call them views of like everything happens for a reason
and she had been talking with her daughter in the sense of like everything happens for a reason
there's some good in this etc and the daughter came and sat with me the mom left she her arms
were crossed her body was turned away she was just completely shut down and um early in the
conversation she said something like if you're gonna tell me that it's good that this happened
fuck off basically and I said no I'm not gonna tell you that it's good that it happened
I'm gonna tell you that it happened and you it's not your fault that it happened but you
have to deal with it you have to make meaning of it and internalize it and there's different ways
you can do that and you can have a very different life based on how you do that and you can
can hate men forever not trust people feel disgust in your body you know you can do have those
things you can also go through a process that could give you the skills to help lots of other
women process similar stuff um and so that you can process this in a way that leads to a more
whole version of you that we could say is good doesn't mean I'm saying it was good that he did
that it's a difference it's an important distinction to make in that everything is perfect so
I the story I would say any belief that any spiritual or kind of worldview belief that
lessens your empathy I'm not a big fan of and so there's a lot of kind of spiritual
philosophic bypass of suffering because we just don't want to deal with it we don't want to feel
it most of us are avoiding our own suffering right we're avoiding facing really certain very
painful things that happened in our life when we were younger certain aspects of our psyche
that we really don't want to look at or feel and so we don't want to be with anybody else's
suffering because to really feel that we would have to go into those states and we're avoiding it
in ourselves so we want to say everything is perfect or um or you get more of what you focus
on to focus on the positive or whatever it is um I think that the ability to transform trauma
requires the ability to be with it fully to feel it acknowledge it which requires no beliefs that
are trying to bypass straight into um it's just really a good thing it to be with the your own
experience and somebody else's experience and so in general I would say the the spiritual views
that make us more responsible to each other
that make us more aware of how that the only reason we're bothered by stuff the the unnecessary
harm to things is because we love them like I wouldn't care that people I wouldn't feel badly
about the girl being raped if I didn't actually care about her existence it's intrinsic to me
being angry at him or heartbroken about that or the reason that we care about the kids in Gaza
or we care about the animals in factory farm the reason we're angry about it or destroyed or in
trauma about it is because there's something intrinsic to the life of those things that we
know is beautiful that we know is meaningful and that it is some kind of sin that is not
acknowledging it and protecting it right it is some kind of error in perception and behavior
and so you in all the awareness of suffering you can trace it and all the awareness of injustice
in in anybody that we can say man there's a lot of really terrible fucked up stuff in the world
I'm upset about it if I trace back who I'm angry at that did it or what I feel afraid of happening
or what I feel devastated about if I trace it to the source of why I care it's because
those aspects of reality are intrinsically meaningful and beautiful to me and I want to see
them doing well and I want to see them thriving so I think it's important to feel all those feelings
and then to trace them back to their source because the source of all of it is love and that's where
the perfection part comes in but then we also realize that in so far as we have some element
of authentic choice and are not purely automata we can make choices that are more and less in
service of the whole and where we have made and are making choices that are not that in
service of the whole that are not coming from perceiving clearly and adding clearly it's important
to see that and to own it to reconcile it how do we align this uh progress narrative with what's
best for the whole how do we align those two I would say that a meaning for something to be
for a change to be considered progress the total set of effects that come from that change
need to be considered not just the you know like you make a technology and your goal is that the
phone does this thing your goal isn't that child slave labor was used in the drc to make
the nickel or the cobalt for the battery your goal wasn't that all the mining tailing pollution
went into the ocean for to really be considered progress you have to factor all of that and
you have to factor the effects on all the beings are all the beings being effected being affected
through the total set of effects is this still progress and I think if we consider the total
consequences of our choices and we say I want to change the world in ways that are actually
comprehensively considerate of all the effects of those changes that's what I would consider
authentic progress and if it is not considering that it's change and it is advancement of some
narrow thing but it's advancement of a narrow thing that is not progress but regress or worse
for lots of other measures that matter and lots of other beings is it possible to have a solution
without unintended consequences it's possible to do orders of magnitude better than we do now
when the PFOS that is in every drop of water that we mentioned earlier
that has carcinogenic and other types of effects affecting all biology
the chemical the chemical companies that invented it actually did animal trials
that showed that it caused cancer they hid those before it had ever went to market
and ended up bringing it to market after hiding those effects
a similar thing happened with the lead additive in gasoline where it was actually known that it
was toxic studies were repressed propaganda about why it was safe was put forward so so
often we say we couldn't have possibly known and we actually did know and we're lying
other times even like you know when early days of Facebook
now social media gets to say we didn't know it was going to polarize the whole population
and increase teen suicide and body dysmorphia and all those things
guys like Geraint Lanier in 2008 were saying all that was going to happen
right they were like openly leading technologists saying look if you monetize attention you're
going to create shorter attention spans drive addiction and take the most the things that
capture people's attention the most because they don't want to spend all their time on site they
want to get the fuck off line and do other things so to keep their time on site because
of your marketing model and keep them engaging you're going to use more and more salacious
addictive kinds of things and that's going to lead into um tribalism and uh you know negative
emotions being pushed and etc and so there were people saying that at the time they were you know
ignored or said to fuck off and then later we get to say plausible deniability we couldn't
possibly know and it's impossible to anticipate on unforeseen externalities i remember one of the
first times that i was kind of young doing work in environmental science and uh company asked me to
do a risk analysis and so i came up with like all these things that would probably happen that were
really bad if they did it and they were like no no we didn't want this like we wanted you to do
the thing that is industry standard risk analysis where you check a bunch of boxes saying this isn't
going to cause any harm so that we can say we did our due diligence and move forward with
possible deniability and like ah so um could we do a much better job of we're inventing a new
technology and really think through if this succeeds what are the supply chains needed to
create it what is going to happen through the radical increase of all those supply chains
what are the behavioral changes of people using this and what are the likely
effects on psychologies and sociologies if this becomes adaptive what other things is
it now out competing you know like blah blah blah there's a way to think through it we
there's a term called red teaming that many people are familiar with it comes from cyber
security and from military games which is you know you're a bank and you're creating a cyber
security structure you take some of your cyber security guys to be hackers and try to break
into it right they're red teaming they're trying to break the thing that you're trying to build to
see if they're vulnerabilities or you take one branch of you know your own military and have
them try to do a attack against your defense systems so um we came up with a this um non-profit
organization I work with we came up with a related process called yellow teaming which is not the
red teaming is saying how might your project fail yellow teaming is if it succeeds what else might
it externalize harm to do the yellow teaming up front and then see where there are harm
externalities how you can change the design to internalize those and make sure that and this
comes that question that you said Jeff Goldblum asked should we do it there is there's a way to go
about inquiring into the should we do it and for some things you'll say no for other things you'll
say well we could change the design in these ways right so obviously if social media had not had an
advertisement model for its revenue model that monetized people's attention where it made more
money as they spent more time on site and as they clicked on engaged in more things
they would have that same underlying technology of curating all the world's information harvesting
that about people and curating the world's information to them if say you had paid for the
service and you could set the settings of how you wanted your mind to be affected you could say
actually I want to be exposed to ideas that are very different than the ideas I currently have
I want not things that appeal to limbic hijacks I want things that have longer
deeper analyses rather than short attention span types of things and so you could develop those
technologies in very different ways if you thought through what the externalities might be and then
said how do we do the design differently there's all this conversation about you know should we
censor hate speech on social media and it's mostly a misnomer because it's not that someone says some
nasty thing that's a problem it's that that thing gets amplified to millions of people in a way that
in a town square would have never happened what is the algorithm that determines if five people
see your thing or 500 million people see see your thing the algorithm actually selects for the things
that cause the most division right because if you get people fighting in a thread the activity of
that thread up regulates the thing so your that algorithm is going to polarize the population
it's going to create more enmity now could you design the algorithm to say we're not going to
maximize for engagement in which case fighting can be engagement we're because we're not talking
about freedom of speech now we're talking about an unprecedented thing in the history of the world
which is the ability to have someone's idea put in front of the whole world and we're differentially
we're the ones the algorithm is getting to choose how much attention this thing gets it's not like
there's some natural selection where if people really like it it's that the algorithm is picking
certain things that it's optimizing how many people's newsfeed it puts it in and what position of
primacy so it's like that has nothing to do with freedom of speech that's a totally different weird
thing and so if you say well we can amplify anybody's ideas what is the basis of the should
the ought associated with the is of which ideas are really worth amplifying right now it's mostly
the worst ones the ones that are intrinsically most divisive and limbic hijacking and attention
capturing and so what if you said okay we're going to look at ideas that or content that gets
generally positive reaction across political lines and across ideological divides meaning
you're finding things that are more shared views than divisive views and that those people can still
post a divisive ones but the ones the algorithm is going to upregulate or those ones you'd have a
very different world you'd have a world in which people started to recognize more and more things
that they share in common that they could then build on and continue to increase rather than like
the weirdest strawman versions of each other that isn't you know even true and you'd have an
incentive for content creators to write things that were actually going to appeal across ideological
divides rather than appeal to one while polarizing the other which actually drives the arms race of
both sides so if you do that kind of anticipate the harms that might occur you might just not do
the thing but you might also do the thing very differently right you might also change the
design in very fundamental ways so if we optimize for very narrow goals don't pay attention to all
the other effects but continue to have exponentially more powerful technologies that scale to the world
faster and have effects in the world much faster the cumulative externalities of that plus the
cumulative rivalry that drives will be extinctionary and this is this kind of comes like from a
mythopoetic perspective it's something like the total amount of technological power that
humanity stewards is not like any other animal right even stone tools were not like any other animal
but the ability to make new species to genetic modification
is really really different the ability to split the nucleus of atoms and make you know
nuclear explosions and nuclear winter the ability to like clear cut whole ecosystems and make cities
the size of tokyo and um and artificial intelligence that can beat all humans combined at defined types
of tasks this is much more like the power of gods of antiquity but without the wisdom of it
and that self-destructs so we have to be we have developed the kind of mind that analyzes parts well
that analyzes a very tiny domain of is called the objective parts interaction that we can define
kind of causal relationships with that we can apply to technology they get selected for if it
grows profits wins and war can convince more people to believe a particular thing
and we have not correspondingly grown the wisdom of what types of tech should be built
and basically what i'm saying is we either have to do that or this process doesn't continue very long
that's really well said my my concern is how is this going to be regulated like you're going to
need a third party to decide hey this second order effect is going to cause a lot of harm
you can't do that you know it instantly makes me think let's say i'm trying to upload a youtube
video and somebody says hey this is going to lead a lot of viewers to go check out some conspiracy
theories that might lead them to oppose the government you can't post this video so i'm
generally i've been butting heads quite a bit with these like policy makers of the algorithm
the regulators because you know as a content creator i'm always fighting them over what i can
and can't post you know i'm always getting things taken down or shadow band and that's very frustrating
so it's yeah it's it's kind of it's a very hard thing to regulate yeah yeah and so
there are twin failure modes that the world faces right now and throughout history there's always been
failure modes that come from whatever the system of social coordination is
government institutions market religion whatever the systems of social coordination are
are not effective and you get increasing chaos right under critical things aren't manufactured
or made that need to be the people are warring with each other there's you know things like that
or uh the failure mode on the other side is that the social coordination system has enough power
to check those things and it itself becomes corrupt and you get tyranny and so there's this
kind of chaos on one side and tyranny on the other twin failure modes and we don't want either of those
and in the same way that we said we're for the first time in history even though empires have
always fallen we're at the place where the thing that you could consider the unit of civilization
is really the entire planet it's these six continents supply chains that make the stuff
that all of the civilizations depend upon and the you know following globalization
we are at a place where for the first time you could have chaos global catastrophic risk
for the whole planet we're also though at the place where you could have
autocratic dystopia for the whole planet right before industrial tech you could not destroy the
ecosystem like you just couldn't fish out all the fish with fishing rods and um but when you have
mile long drift nets where you can pull up whole schools of fish all day long yeah you can overfish
the whole ocean right but it's the scale of the tech before nuclear weapons we couldn't destroy
everything quickly even if we wanted to there were people who really tried and so the scope of the
catastrophic potential is related to our technological capacity but the same technology can also make
control dystopias right so and this is you can see the intuitions of people focus on one of these
problems or the other there are people who are just terrified of all regulation and typically tend
to think that it's almost always corrupt or whatever and there are other people who are terrified of
what um especially exponentiating tech and market forces due to the world uh without anything
checking them and those are both right they're both right and so there is a place where to think
about this correctly you have to embrace the rock and the hard place and not just focus on one and not
the other because the solution to one ends up being the other one so um we can see that
multipolar traps between major nations lead to probably destruction of everything right you the
nations in uh in multipolar traps with each other are all extracting more fossil fuels every year
are all externalizing all their pollution costs because nobody wants to internalize the pollution
costs themselves if everyone else doesn't and then have less margins to compete everybody is putting
more energy into militaries etc so you're like okay the competitive nature between the countries will
destroy everything so then of course one proposed solution is we need a one world government so we
don't have that situation and yet of course we can see that where power has become very concentrated
it has become corrupt in proportion to its concentration everywhere and so the idea of a
one world government obviously that in the time of the roman empire or whatever you couldn't really
see what everybody was doing you couldn't enforce rule of law because of the technological limitations
but in an age where we have real-time imaging of every spot on the surface of the earth every day
through satellites and increasingly all of the sensor data all of the satellite data it can all
be fed to ai's big enough to process all of that you could have a terrifying global dystopic control
state and if that and when we talk about checks and balances on power if let's say we recognize how
destructive uh decentralized artificial intelligence the way it is developing right now could be
because can you use it to uh make better chemical weapons to make better bio weapons to figure out
better infrastructure attacks to make better fake news to make better propaganda yeah you
can use it for all those things and even the things that you say are good things are good in
the definition in the in the market that does the narrow success thing so you just speed up the
narrow success in the total externalities so uh we'd say no the ai's going to save the environment
because it's going to give us all these efficiencies we have continued to make more efficient tech
every year while using more energy every year because efficiency doesn't mean you use less it
means the cost of the industrial input goes down so new market sectors open up that weren't
profitable before that's called the jevons paradox and it's one of the really critical
things to understand here is that if if in all kind of environmental type dynamics is when the
cost of energy goes down we use more energy not less when the cost of compute goes down we use
more compute not less when the cost of material acquisition goes down use more not less because
of certain like let's say the cost of energy goes down now there's this whole area that i can mine
that i couldn't afford to mine before because the you know cost to extract it wasn't enough of the
market value but now that my energy costs are lower now i can mine a lot more areas and put more
mining pollution and industrial tailings into the water so in the market type dynamics that
we have now where almost every goal happens at the expense of lots of externalities even the
quote unquote good things that you use ai to optimize end up driving the rate of the externalities
faster let alone all of the weaponized kinds of applications so okay so let's say we're like man
that's really bad and everybody's racing to do it and we're doing we're doing the exact opposite of
like thoughtful forecasting and testing and seeing what the same thing would be we're doing the here's
chat gpt let's roll it out to hundreds of millions of people instantly let's get governments to start
using it let's get companies based on it where then once you find out how bad it is you can't
roll it back because the entire economy depends upon it um the speed of deployment scale of ai
right now compared to say of oil when you know you uh u.s uh standard oil was developing is so
mind-blowingly fast um like the speed to a hundred million users in a week with threads or something
like that um and that's the exact opposite of how you make sure that you are not causing a lot of
harm is you do a lot of protracted thinking and then when you implement it you do a lot of observation
of the implementation at a smaller scale so you have a safe to fail probe and then you make changes
on it because of the things you couldn't have anticipated without doing some experiments
not rapid speed to scale okay so you say well what if we right now we're not succeeding on
regulating it in any good way it is proceeding and the applications of it are uh are really terrifying
but let's say we could and we said all right we're we're going to stop all of the kind of market
application of that thing until we have and the burden of proof has to be on proving that it's
adequately safe not that it can destroy stuff like lead and dbt and then later after does all
the destruction then we regulate it at this level of power by the time we realize the destruction
that it's caused it will be too late and irreversible okay well if we did regulate it and say we're
not going to allow that who is the we right that would actually because there's so much market
investment that would take government intervention using monopoly of violence rule of law backed by
monopoly of violence to shut it down do you know that military contractors and um classified
projects are not still developing the same things like it does that get shut down in the same regulation
pretty hard to know that and if it's not then you're still developing that tech just with no
checks and balances right such that um the monopoly of power now is nearly an infinite monopoly of
power this is the hardest issue humanity is facing right now is that the market forces
without very strong regulation will drive us past planetary boundaries and
lots of other global catastrophic risks incentives alone are not enough to fix it it needs deterrence
and yet they're the regulatory systems don't have the visibility the integrity the uh checks and
balances they need to be trusted with the power needed to regulate all of that so we both have to
basically restructure governance such that the transparency accountability etc necessary to
regulate things is there with actually the wisdom at the basis is there and have it do that very
quickly and obviously the chances of that don't sound good um it doesn't fundamentally require
violating any laws of physics to do it it's just a hard thing to accomplish but it's important to hold
that the control dystopia and the decentralized catastrophe that the solutions to one usually
make the other one worse and the actual solutions we're interested in are neither and this is where
we need to actually deepen our understanding of the failure modes hold them together and hold
designing away from both as the design constraints
yeah because right now with AI it's advancing so fast it seems like each week there's some new
giant update when you look at AI from a year ago it's it's a joke compared to what crazy deep fake
things they're coming out with today and they're talking about regulating it but it seems like
it's just advancing so fast by the time they try to figure out some regulating laws it's going to be
like 20 20 000 years more advanced and correct yeah the tech is evolving at the intersection of
multiple exponential curves and I mean formally exponential so you know we started to understand
exponential curves in tech with like Moore's law where you would get this progressive doubling of
compute speed you know per cost every couple years
right now just in the hardware in the AI space right the GPU cluster hardware it is 10xing
in six months and the rate of that is increasing
so you have an exponential curve in hardware you have an exponential curve in the amount of data
available you have an exponential curve in the amount of capital being invested and
people working in the space an exponential curve in the software development of the you
know cognitive architectures involved and all of those are intersecting and law is not only
still working as slowly as it did in the founding of this country it's working slower because of
increasing polarization of the population that is elected increasingly polarized representatives
that disagree on everything and so the nature of our so and that's important to say the social
media is actually an early AI right it's using an early form of AI to be able to curate all of the
world's content to maximize its stickiness for you and behavioral dynamics for you based on
harvesting behavioral data about you so deep fakes now are creating content that first one
was curating content the curating content is very powerful because that creates the incentive
for every other content producer in the world to produce stuff that the algorithms want
including mainstream news and everything else that increasingly is successful only in so far as
it's successful there so that technology has simultaneously decreased the capacity of government
to govern has decreased the clarity of thinking and collective intelligence of the population
increase their enmity and increase their certainty and wrongness at the same time
which is a terrible combination right increasing certainty with decreasing scope of understanding
on both sides or all sides of most issues while increasing the rate of the tech development
itself and increasing the amount of capital allocated to it so obviously that regulatory system is dead
and the you the regulatory system has to be able to move at a speed of the technology
that is being developed or it has no chance at all that requires some very fundamental
innovations and how we think of governance and of course if the founding fathers were alive today
and not doing the thing in 1776 and they were looking at the tech stack today and the issues now
they would not have come up with the exact same thing they even in those people right they would
have come up with a different set of things because obviously so the amount of innovation in tech
does require innovation in social technology how do we coordinate that well and innovation in
social technology not just that can move faster and be more powerful like deregulation of the
markets and venture capital and stuff but innovation in social technology that is actually aligned with
the viable future what do you what do you think it'll mean to be a human when AI can do everything
better and faster what what's going to be human's roles in this post AI world that's coming
on the primary current approaches to AI I don't think it will be able to do everything faster
and better than humans but it will do lots of things right if you look at LLMs right now
and you talk to them you'll notice that
so your listeners have probably heard the talk of that they hallucinate hallucinates not really
the right term they confabulate they'll make shit up that sounds right but that isn't true
because they don't actually understand right they're not actually understanding concepts at any
in any meaningful way they're looking at statistical relationships between the likelihood of the next word
seeming reasonable to the sentence factoring all of human language and so they'll make sentences
that sound good and if you don't know anything sound reasonable sometimes they're quoting stats
that are completely fabricated you know and made up sometimes the understanding is extremely distorted
um you'll also notice that recombining concepts that exist happens a lot more than anything
like novelty of insight so the the kind of cognitive architectures that are being used
are different in kind than the types of cognitive architectures happening inside of humans now
there are obviously people who are studying how it happens in humans trying to replicate that so
it might go in different directions the direction in which it's currently going um and not just LLMs
but the AIs in general is mostly optimized for near-term maximum market applications so we're
getting very good at using them for weapons targeting for um things like you know some good
things like energy grid distribution type things and solving traveling salesman problems for
supply chains and stuff um but also stuff like making believable ish content at a
unbelievable scale and speed that will become most of all content online very soon that is um
has no actual connection to reality the thing that is generating it has no actual understanding
of reality so that's pretty bad i do so let's but i understand what you're asking which is
if we've already had a bunch of jobs be automated in the past there have been the creation of new
jobs um nobody's all that upset that elevators got automated and that there isn't you know someone
having to be the elevator man because there were new jobs that were created in the process
that automation and just to get a sense like the internal combustion engine tractor
has made it to where there are 150 as many people involved in food production as there were before
so that's a pretty humongous automation of you know human activity with AI some people are like
ah it'll automate a lot of jobs but it'll also make a lot of new jobs and so there won't be job
issue it's fundamentally not true about AI in the same way that it's true about other things because
like the other technologies came from the type of human intelligence that can figure out how to
make a new thing right the internal combustion and the automated elevator came from human
intelligence doing a certain thing AI is actually trying to make the technology of that type of
human intelligence at exponentially more scale that will identify yes it'll create new market
niches but then it will simultaneously figure out how to automate them that's very different
obviously there's a lot of versions of that world that look pretty dystopic and if you advance that
world and you keep capitalism as the underlying system then at least in the past where there was
a need for labor that you had a surf class that had some utility to the elites as opposed to no
utility at all this is also though why some people running AI companies are fans of
some kind of universal basic income is because
the if they're competing for who wins master of the galaxy who will actually own everything and
all of the creative capacity and means of production whatever having the people not rebel is worth
some small amount while they while they increasingly get their needs met in a digital universe that
costs us almost nothing less than a physical universe while they are mostly obsolete and then
that gets packaged as a nicer idea of like oh we'll have this time to pursue creative endeavors and
stuff so you know the good part of the question the good part of the AI question is a thought
experiment is if you could automate all of the tasks that humans do or at least most of the tasks
that humans do what is a meaningful human life and what is unique to what it means to be human
that is not simply task fulfillment that's actually a really good question and
it grounds an experience right we're not building AI's that can appreciate sunsets
we are building AI's that can say words that sound like empathy but are not empathy
the what is you amongst other things one thing that is unique to being a sentient thing as opposed
to just an intelligent thing is the capacity for experience and the capacity for shared experience
and it's definitely true that in the future that i hope for a much higher percentage of
everyone's time will be allocated to things that are in the domain of interpersonal care
so if we could automate a lot of things that humans do and or also make a world system where
so much of the stuff that we do that is totally unnecessary and basically just kind of a racket
we have this is another actual important point i'll take a tangent the multipolar trap in the
same way we said some people will start a company and know that the thing is going to be harmful
lie about it and then when it's found out that it's harmful say it's impossible to anticipate
enforcing things we couldn't have possibly known right so they the fact that it's hard to anticipate
enforcing things is kind of a source of plausible deniability or in a more generous case they don't
know but they don't try really hard to know they don't spend a lot of research dollars looking at
why we shouldn't do this thing because there's the guy who does that doesn't win first mover advantage
and spend all of it on optimizing how to do the thing fastest which is why law has increasingly
you know made corporate personhoods under laws that were made for slavery so that the directors
were protected so the people actually making the choices can't get prosecuted for the activity of
the company and blah blah blah so in the same way that saying what we couldn't anticipate
externalities is usually a lie oftentimes the multipolar trap is a lie we have to because they are
the groups that say that the most or the actual most powerful ones that could create agreements
to change it but also the ones that believe they can win the the people that don't believe they can
win are way more likely to make an agreement to say let's all not do this thing the ones that are
like no i think i can win they'll say we couldn't possibly stop the ai race with you know because
china's going to get there first whatever so we have to be this race we're saying it like if the
us really wanted to stop the ai arms race really really authentically wanted that because they saw
the risk of it saw that was no good for anyone could they do the geopolitical work to get china
to cooperate and then the two of them lead the rest of the world in the cooperation yes i believe so
but the guy that thinks it can win doesn't want to do that and the people that came to power in
the rivalrous context of win the cooperator better at that mode of mind than the other mode of mind
so it's also important to understand that the most powerful players within a multi-polar trap
actually have the power to bind it or change it but they're usually the ones driving it
in which case the argument of the multi-polar trap is largely the justification for their
their own attempt to win
that's a great point about how yeah if you're if you're not in a position to win of course you're
going to make a deal that makes perfect sense so i guess that's very telling if somebody's uh
not willing to make a deal they're uh kind of indirectly revealing their intentions
often and they'll say we're willing they're not willing so we're forced into this while hiding
all of the things that the other side isn't willing because of the way we defected on all of our deals
with them historically or things like that well we've we've gone on for for a good amount of time
but there's still some questions i'd really like to ask you if you have to leave let me know but
but um something i've been really interested in is it seems like our institutions are falling
apart right now or we've got hollywoods falling apart our academic institutions um the mainstream
media government it seems like a lot of these institutions are crumbling and i'm wondering
is this all related is there one common thing that's causing all these to fall apart or
are we just losing faith in our institutions do we need our institutions
is there is there a way to save them
i think i've been the most interested in the the academic
focus of this just seeing the the downfall of colleges and people saying it's not for me anymore
and a lot of young people checking out
i think it's good though i think we need colleges but i think that they're
misaligned with what society actually needs
you want me to talk about colleges or institutions in general um
i guess we could probably start with colleges
let me start by talking about democracy i think that's a relevant frame because the higher order
institutions can textualize or other ones uh you had asked me in the emails democracy ending
um so this is basically the concept of the institution of nation states
being able to be something like you know liberal democracies as opposed to
autocracies or something else um in one way there is a really important critique that democracies
have never really existed that the founding of the us had all of the shitty jobs done by slaves
who had no say in the fact that they did all the shitty jobs obviously women didn't have a say of the
time um and that if people had to democratically vote for the totality of what happened but where
the people who were voting were also responsible for all of the labor uh that that whole system
wouldn't have worked where if they had had to actually pay fair labor that people would have
voted for that wasn't exploited it wouldn't have had the margins to grow the way that it did things
like that um and you see that after the civil war was fought we didn't end slavery because the
peonage system just kind of extended the slavery right the 13th amendment said not shall not be
slaves except as a punishment for a crime so a bunch of fake crimes were made up to be able to
put black people in prison and put them on basically forced labor uh again when that ended
it was largely associated with globalization and the ability to ship the slavery to the third world
so there are more people in indentured servitude or conditions of slavery today than there have
been at any point in the history of the world and we ship most of the cheap labor and really
environmentally harming things whatever to those areas that are a part of the margins of how things
work so calling out democracy is kind of weird um obviously inside of the corporations those are
not democracies those are basically autocracies right which do a huge amount of everything and
the military is not a democracy and etc so there's only a little bit that was supposedly
democracy and it's really hard to say that it was that thing but even in so far as it was
that thing has eroded in some very significant ways that require restructuring of the entire idea set
specifically that was able to happen here in the way that it was and each of the modern democracies
have different but related stories because it was basically the whole continent separated from
any kind of adversaries with oceans and that was a huge part of why certain things were possible
and that you could share with the population things that you wouldn't want to share with
enemies and it wouldn't instantly get to the enemy such that the people could be apprised
of key decisions to make but as technology advanced and telecommunications emerged and
very good ability to spy emerged and the ability to actuate in other places through
missiles and you know things much faster than ships going across the ocean emerged
sharing information with the citizens equaled sharing it with the soviets
right and sharing it with any kind of adversary and so all the things that were of importance to
national security couldn't be shared and increasingly everything started to become an issue of national
security because issues about our water supply and key issues about our food supply and key issues
about what the Fed is going to do with finances and you know etc all start to be increasingly
national security things becoming increasingly classified and how do you do democracy if most
of the most important decisions no one's even allowed to know any of the information about
and yet in a situation of adversaries being able to listen from across the world
and also being able to actuate from across the world how do you share all of the information
that is sensitive to the population this is an issue that democracy faces today that it
did not face in 1776 and um let's take that one a little bit further you know when popper wrote
about open society and that kind of the idea of democracy also went along with the idea of the
open publishing of science everybody could know what was happening in science and academia and
because everybody could be comprehensively educated right that the antecedents for democracy and all
the founding documents was the comprehensive education of everyone and the comprehensive
informanness of everyone so everybody had to have public education everybody had to have a kind of
free and independent news media for the state such that the population could both had the
education to make sense of things and the information to make sense of things such that they could make
good informed decisions we can see that the level of education that the American population has
relative to the complexity of the issues it faces so what understanding of the history of the
israel palestine conflict or ukraine russia dynamics or all the geopolitics involved or
the risks associated with crisper artificial intelligence or the actual condition of
dead zones and oceans like how much of the dynamics regarding that the good regulation
would need just the public understand anything about obviously the complexity of the information
space has increased exponentially and the educational quality as in many ways went down
simultaneously and the news has been you know increasingly uh you know partisanized blah blah
blah so the antecedents for democracy are not in place do you have a population that is educated
enough well informed enough in ways that are not just the propaganda vested interests to be able to
make good choices adequate to the complexity of the choices we need to make in the timescales
like obviously not even close so there is a study i think it was done by braver angels or at least
popularized by them that showed that since the 1970s popular opinion has zero percent correlation
with legislation what the people want has absolutely no effect on legislation that's crazy the
amount of marketing i mean the amount of lobbying dollars has perfect correlation
and so now again we come back to the topic you're asking about captured government so the kind of
core idea of this liberal democracy thing was that the market would naturally get power law
distributions if you just had a pure market you end up getting a situation where some people are
better at making money than others that money is power for everything because that money is like
a unit of game theory right it's like a token that allows you to buy private mercenaries it allows
you to buy marketing it allows you to buy labor tech whatever so if you i need to change the views
of people i need to get politicians on my side i need to build some new technology i need to buy
land money is something that has no intrinsic value but optionality for every type of value
and so everyone started valuing money more than anything else because it represented the
optionality for everything else which is obviously game theoretically relevant
and so some people would be better at making money than others they those who have more money have
more ability to make more money even just through compounding interest compounding interest grows
faster than the general market does this is what piquetti showed in capital in the 21st century
that um in the rich will get richer poor will get poorer intrinsic to the system even if it wasn't
for the fact also that the rich get better education and better health care and better access to
financial services and you know all those types of things so you'll naturally get a power law
distribution where the wealth inequality increases over time until it's so in balance that if you
just had a market like that you didn't have a kind of state then pretty much everybody has no
voice only the people the amount of voice you have to determine the world is proportional to the
amount of money and that ends up really sucking for a lot of things right and there's a lot of
things where there's market incentive to do the thing that you we still don't want to do we don't
want to cut down all the national parks we don't want all of the markets on organs and stuff like
that so we decide now we're going to have a state but we want a minimal state the job of the state
is to serve the collective will of the people including the people who don't have a lot of money
and the state has to be powerful enough to check the powerful forces in the market such
that where the powerful forces in the market have a vested interest to do something that is actually
bad for the whole and the whole all agrees we don't want that you're able to check it that's
really the purpose of the state is to check excesses of the market aligned with the will of the people
assuming that there is both a moral and scientific education of all of the people and
comprehensive informativeness of them such that the will of the people would be a good idea now
so it's supposed to be that the state is checking the market but the people are checking the state
it's supposed to be a government of foreign by the people where the there's high transparency that
people are not career politicians they're elected from the people you know those kinds of things and
obviously we do not have a situation where the government is of foreign by the people and the
people are effectively checking the state as a result the state is no longer effectively
checked in the market the market ends up capturing the state so if the market is going to be regulated
by the state in a way that decreases its profits then its own responsibility to grow as a business
is to do lobbying to change the legislation in favor of its interests now the private sector
can pay for a bunch of lawyers to write a bunch of law in a way that the general people can't the
and so we have a world today where the vast majority of all new law is written by the
private sector in its own interests you have a situation of the revolving doors where the
someone from industry moves into the position of being the regulator who's regulating
in the interest of the companies they were just employed by and will be employed by again after
their term is over right that revolving door so if if your FDA commissioner had worked in
Big Pharma or Big Ag and then goes to work there afterwards like what's the chance that that's good
regulation and you'll you will also have things like public private partnerships which are key to
how ai is being regulated right now which is okay because the government is too slow and you guys
don't really know where the current tech is at and because you don't have the money in the budget
for it we the market sector who are advancing the tech and know where it's really at and have the
expertise and we can afford to do it we understand that this needs regulated there's some risks here
so we're going to create a partnership between the government side and the private side well who
ends up writing the operating agreement always the private side that ends up being able to pay
for the lawyers and who in which interest in the interest of regulating their own activity so heavily
that it affects their their market capabilities obviously not so they're almost everywhere that
you see revolving doors that you see lobbying that you see public private partnerships you see
basically a state that is doing the bidding of the market and specifically what that means
is the interest of some in the market not in the interest of everybody and not in the interest of
the commons so is that democracy no right so for them and when your only choices for who is an
elected representative are people that nobody likes in on either side and that nobody really
got to have any good say up front and who might be involved in that process they just kind of
came out of nowhere picked by parties and stuff and where at best you get to vote yes or no on a
proposition but the proposition sucks in both ways and you weren't involved in any part participatory
process of crafting what would be a good proposition in the first place so we we have a kabuki theater
of democracy we don't have democracy right um but we also couldn't have democracy in the 1776
style with these issues so given that we have innovated our tech to the place that we still
have adversarial relationships with other places in the world but they can be spying on us with
satellites in real time and use the information the public has and infiltrate the public through
you know um us intelligence and law enforcement identified that the 16 top most popular evangelical
facebook groups were all run by russian troll farms and so the russian troll farm is curating
the stuff in those groups that turns the people against other people and against the state so
how do you deal with a you know powerful opponent turn them against themselves um a lot of people
thought oh russia likes trump and china likes biden no russia and china both like a us that is more
divided with itself and the same the way that we are with them right like the try to sow division
is a is a thing is a strategy um what we want with a democracy is that the choices that affect
everyone's life everyone gets to participate in the making of those choices as much as possible
that people's lives are not subject to things that they have no say in and in so far as we can also
really well educate everybody and um obviously even when i say we can that's a very tricky thing
who is the we and what are they calling good education is a very tricky thing and so far
as it is possible to have a competent and shared understanding of the world emerge
and effective ability to communicate across different worldviews towards things that don't
just turn into a war then democracy is increasingly viable only in that cultural antecedent
and the mechanisms by which that could be mediated moving forward have to be completely
different than they have been before because the context is completely different
that was brilliantly explained thank you for that and i've heard an idea i don't i don't know if
you've heard this but the smaller the group of people the more trust there is and so the more
open you can have a society so like with your family you want to be a socialist and just
share everything with your community you can be a a communist with your region you can be a
democrat but with a large the bigger you get the less trust there is so of course people are going
to be more skeptical and that's kind of one of the defining features of conservatives is
they're very paranoid and skeptical of the government i tend to yeah
it is in the interest of the
it's hard to even define what this is it is in the interest of the political class
to have people skepticism stay partisan
so as long as the republicans say that the um liberals are the ones who want big government
and are ruining everything and ruining education and etc and but their whole answer is to
not really engage in deep democratic process where they're involved in making sense of the
world and crafting what good propositions would be and involving the systems of government it's to
get the guy that is saying that the liberals are bad who's their guy elected to still run the system
with almost none of their authentic understanding or input and this and the liberals doing the
exact same thing then you get to take everybody's recognition that the system isn't working and
keep perpetuating the system and have them all work very hard to to do something that is obviously
just perpetuating the system grigory bateson coined this term schismogenesis which is where the
schism is actually the generator of the ongoing growth in the system and so you have a movement
say and it appeals to some people and it anti appeals to other people and it's not that all
movements must do that but it's that movements that are crafted in a way that let's say we have
values that are in a dialectical relationship and you have to consider them together like
rights and responsibilities or whatever and one emphasizes one you have a movement that
emphasizes one of these and some people who are really paying attention to that thing will really
care and other people who recognize there's something really imbalanced about a care over here
so you can have a movement where the success of that movement actually really scares other people
in the same way that you said earlier as one nation increases its relative security it decreases
the security of everybody else so now everybody else has to increase their process now that just
means arms race is forever is the only possible answer increasing the total killing power of
the world the entire time while increasing the enmity you know of everybody so it's like this
is not a good in game so similarly you have a movement that says some true things but leaves
out some really important things and as a result it appeals to some people and other people or it
emphasizes certain values not other ones and so that movement success drives its counter movement
and so it never actually wins it's so focused on a near term win but if it innovates any method
of being more successful now we're going to use social media and elections or now we're going
to know whatever it is the other side instantly reverse engineers it innovates that's the same
kinds of things and intrinsic to how one side is appealing to their support base they are
anti-appealing to the other side they're actually driving the counteraction on the other side
so any attempt to change the world that is schismogenic will not create a good world
and if you want to create a good world you want to think about how does this look from everybody's
perspective and what is a more complete understanding of the world that integrates all those perspectives
and how could we move that thing forward that's very different
yeah it seems like a lot of these politicians and the arguments that we hear are just distractions
for what you know the power that's really going on in the background
so um i'm really thankful that you've taken this time to answer these questions and every
time we talk i have to think and reflect for quite a long time because i have some
cognitive biases and things and you are really good at addressing those and and just making
me think of like my blind spots and there's there's certain things that you've said that have made
me think and really just back off on certain things that i'm i feel strongly about and really
reevaluate them and i i don't think i've ever talked to anybody that has had that much of an
effect on my thinking just from conversations you know so thank you you said something really
important that i think is a good closing point people should be really dubious of their own
certainty it's it's sad how much this is true but the amount that people really actually think
is amazingly low and so in general if you give me four or five of someone's political views what
they think on gun control what they think on abortion what they think on climate change what
they think on covid whatever and i can predict the rest of their views with high accuracy it's
hard to say that they're thinking they are in a memetic complex that is the moment you identify
the memetic complex you know the vast majority of everything that i think and so similarly if
you're in a conversation with someone and pretty soon you know what their response is to most things
are going to be and they're actually more predictable than chat gpt is they don't even
pass the turing test right like most people don't even pass the turing test when you're talking to
them of like are they saying anything that indicates that there is some real depth of
consideration and sentience and whatever on the other side um and so uh i think david boom said
that most people are engaged in thoughting that thoughts arise and new ideas come in they hit
the person's existing cognitive biases and memetic filters those filters either reject
or accept the thought if they accept that they seek to propagate it by trying to sell other people
on the idea and that pretty much they're a mostly unconscious meme filtering and propagation system
this is really sad and also unnecessary and so you can correct this but you have to
care about what is real more than any of your ideas about what is real
and any place where your identity is associated with an idea i'm a pro-science person or i'm
anti-vax person or i'm a zionist or i'm a anti-zionist or i'm a conservative your identity
will probably have to die when you recognize that those ideas are very limited and that
there are ideas on the other side that are also good and so similarly if there are ideas that you
hold on to because they support your vested interests like the way that you make money and get
the way that you got your fame and the whatever it is is a good thing um so there is a depth of
earnestness to be like no no i i actually want to understand the reality i exist and i was born
i don't know why i'm here for a very short period of time and then i'll be dead there's this amazing
reality i didn't make i want to understand it i want to understand how it works i want to understand
what's meaningful about it so that i can live in the most authentic and meaningful way possible
then if that's the case then what you are more curious about than anything is your own
blind spots and your own biases and you want to investigate them profoundly you don't want to
ever double down on them so if if you have a you know you make a list what are all the things that
i believe fervently then find who are the smartest people that disagree and really listen
because there might be people who have studied this way more than you know way more stuff and
they disagree for some important reasons and maybe they're not a hundred percent right either right
in fact finding where experts disagree in a field is one of the best ways to enter the field
because if they've studied the field for decades with deep earnestness more than your you know
cursory understanding and they disagree it means that maybe none of the world views or
epistemologies are adequate and you want to say can i understand why each of them think what they
do can i understand where the difference is and maybe because i'm not as invested is there a
chance i might be more plastic and i could see is there a view in which there are partial truths
and what each of them are saying and so to just look at where do i hold fervently to something
and who are the smartest people that disagree and really try to take it in
that will do so much to improve the quality of your thinking your understanding of the world
and also just the quality of you as a human being who will lead with more respect with other people
that will have more authentic humility one of the other things like any
when you start to learn about a topic there's this dunning kruger process right where before
you know a lot about it you can have confidence in it because you just don't know how much stuff
you don't know and then as you learn more you become aware how much you don't know if you really
stay attuned to how much stuff is there like peruse more scientific journals and just look
at how many words all the cutting-edge stuff is being talked about that you just have no idea what
the fuck we're talking about at all i don't know what this kind of proteomics is and i don't know
what this kind of transformer is and i don't know what this kind of metafluid is and i don't know
and just start to do take in more of how much you have no idea about things
and the certainty gets replaced with both curiosity and humility and all
and as a result you start learning a lot more and the fascinating thing is you learn a lot more
so your views get more accurate and less certain at the same time
a world in which everybody worked to have a lot more epistemic rigor
and also was aware of how much they don't know so there's still humility in every
situation and conversation uh that's a world that would actually be capable of some kind
of democratic process working i just finished a video on why smart people believe stupid things
and it was all about cognitive bias and how to overcome it and it's interesting the video
made a case that smart people are more prone to cling to really idiotic ideas because they can
rationalize them better and and we made a case that the antidote to this cognitive bias was
curiosity the more curious you are about things the more it'll extinguish the cognitive bias so
you know just being curious it's it's a great way to live
the smart person can rationalize and the interesting thing is that rationalizing is
the opposite of rationality right the idea of rationality is that we're taking some
like hopefully clear formal process of assessing the world rationalization is you come to a belief
based on in-group identity or motivated reasoning or whatever types of things and then you rationally
backfill why you came there but the reason that you say you came there and why you actually came
there aren't the same but you probably have low enough psychological insight that you don't realize
that and so one should be very very attentive to their own rationalization and motivated reasoning
but the other thing is that the smart person because they have an identity as a smart person
and maybe they are a they have a job as a smart person supported by the people who support them
to believe that stuff because they speak to an audience on the left or an audience on the right
who wants them to be the smart person who says those things or if they started saying more
nuanced things they would lose their support base so it's not just that they're better capable of
rationalizing it might also be that they start to get success and identity associated with
narrow applications of smart just like narrow applications progress it's like audience capture
audience capture market capture incentive capture all those things
yes it's pretty big in the influencer world where your audience is going to want a more
extreme version of the character you're playing and so you have to get more and more extreme so
then the question is who's doing the influencing you or the audience yeah I would say that
the spend more time in deathbed reflections because you won't be stoked on having become that person
right the person that was not based on the most earnest understanding of reality and not based
on your deepest truth but based on the appeal to more status and incentive who won't end up being
the stuff you're proud of that's very deep yeah I live right near hospice so I should probably
walk on over there just check in it's a really beautiful thing to do this is actually one of
the other things that I think is particularly tragic in our society we talked about how in
tribal society the old people and the young people were the actual central axis with the knowledge
transfer and sinking being key so obviously we ship our old people out to nursing homes and
whatever where they're on lots of meds and then put in front of the tv with the lowest cost workers
taking care of them and we ship our kids out to the same type of thing a daycare and then a school
with the lowest cost workers because we only take care of our kids if we can't make more money then
it costs us to pay for someone else to take care of our kids extending that further is the medicalization
of birth and death where most people haven't been to births and they haven't been with many people
as they die again in a tribal environment everybody's with all the deaths all the births by the time a
person is going into birth themselves they've been with so many of them they don't have the
unknown and the fear around it by the time someone's dying they've been through the death of almost
everybody they know right and they're the most sacred beautiful experiences and spending more
time with them it also it contextualizes the shit that you think is so important that just isn't
and the kind of self-center and so I would love more people to spend more time with the dying
and to spend more time with infants and little kids and with birth and death itself
when you go to the hospice you'll also notice
that just because someone is old and dying does not mean they lived a life that gave them much
wisdom and you'll see that some people are approaching it with a lot of terror and regret
and agony and some people approach it with like tremendous grace and gratitude and beauty
and it does have to do with how they lived and that's also a really important thing to watch
and pay attention to wow yeah I'm uh I'm thinking a lot about these things lately I recently just
found out I'm going to be a dad oh wow yeah so I've been you know my priorities have really shifted
and you know now I really got to get my act together yes congratulations yeah thanks I don't
think there is anything that I have ever seen that is generally as powerful for motivating someone
to grow into their own values as parenting if you're thoughtful enough to realize
that your kid's going to get all your issues
yeah they're going to get your they're going to get your gifts they're going to get your
issues they're going to get your blind spots they're going to get your all those things
and that what you tell them will influence them less than who you are and so if you
tell them something you can't live what they're really going to get is how you actually are
and then a sense of a lot of conflict and incongruence and shame from the disparity of the
messages and so if you're like fuck I really and and when they're little and very neuroplastic
they're never going to be that neuroplastic again that doesn't mean there is not chance
for healing and growth and redemption later there is but you're like that time is very unique
and their first year their first three years are so much more important to their life than
those years are to you for your life right like you're not imprinting the core of your nervous
system and how you're going to be for the rest of forever they are and so when you realize that
you're like damn I am not the most important thing to pay attention to and so much of the
stuff I couldn't overcome for my own purpose I have to overcome for them so I hope I hope a lot of
insights and integrations for you in that time oh man thank you I really appreciate it and
I'm going to take all your advice to heart because it's left me with a lot of stuff to
think about for sure I look forward to hear the follow up thoughts and maybe we'll come and
do another conversation
