what we can do and he's like but should we and they all look at him like he's crazy but it turns
out that that was a great question to ask yes and it came from the least scientific person there
which is a good showcase of human nature right there and yes i like what you said about how
when the game's ending everybody starts really going for self-interest because they they have to
but if the game never ends then it's about cooperation and i i think that you see this in
nature where like you'll see a giant shark and it's got these little fish eating bacteria off it
and that's a symbiotic relationship you also see it with like chimps or other animals that groom
each other you know there's really no benefit to yourself for grooming somebody else but
if you cooperate with them if you groom them they might groom you and it's like this cooperation
relationship um that i think benefits everybody so that you reminded me of that and i love what
you said about how science is what is and religion is kind of runs the domain of what ought because
i think that really speaks to both the issues in those fields like science in the realm of facts
science reign supreme but they really struggle with coming up with morals and ethics and principles
whereas in the realm of religion oftentimes we make fun of them for getting their facts so wrong
but in other realms you know they really have it right and that's why religion's been around
for so many thousands of years because it it seems like it might be factually incorrect but it's
metaphorically correct and yeah yeah and i wouldn't even say that um science says what is
is science can explore what is exclusively in the domain of the objective not the subjective
not the intersubjective and specifically in the domain of the subset of the objective things
that are measurable which is not everything and repeatedly measurable and yet still it is only
going to tell us as much as those very small number of things we've measured so far and if i'm
if i'm observing or measuring anything there might be a nearly infinite number of things
i could observe about it right if i'm trying to study the body there's a lot of things happening
in the body which ones do we study and so if i get a measurement and now i say this thing is
happening that's not how the body works that's how that tiny little molecular target works
how does the body work we continue to discover almost every day a whole new domain of
types of molecules types of systems that we didn't even know about before
and so science can tell us only in the domain of the objective only in very limited context some
things about what is and so there's a humility to recognizing that and obviously it's still
powerful enough that we can land a rover on mars using that and we can split the nucleus of an atom
and we can edit the genome and make new species and we can make a large hadron collider that
has pulses that are hotter than the surface of the sun and so it's extraordinarily powerful for some
things but the insights that have been offered about anything in the domain of meaning
are actually at best inferences from some things that the mostly the domains of science that are
focused on the limitations of science tell us right things like complexity science things like
uh deep ecology that are looking at what the limits of reduction of science were and the
way you have to look at not just to understand a thing you have to understand its parts but
to understand a thing you have to understand what it's a part of that contextualizes it makes it that
way yes you're reminding me uh for many years i worked at a psych institute that was part of a
medical school and psychiatry was kind of seen as the ugly cousin within the medical school because
it wasn't as objective and i remember there was a big insecurity in the psych institute because
they wanted to be a hard science so they really leaned into like neuroscience and neurotransmitters
and they they tried to say that mental health issues were a chemical imbalance that's where
we got that idea and that if you're sad it's just because your your mechanics are off and here we
just add a little bit more chemicals here and that'll fix you right up and i think that got us into
a lot of trouble yeah um if i say that you're sad because you have some mysterious biochemical
deficiency we don't say why we don't ask if it has anything to do with your diet or your exercise
or lifestyle or anything like that first we assume that it's the physical body being off
because that's what we study is the physical objective world nothing about the field of your
relationships or your sense of meaning or unresolved trauma or anything else um
and then we so we first assume the mind issues from the body then we assume the body is just
wrong for some reason that we don't know and that an external chemical solution is the answer
and uh specifically a patentable one where we will be able to charge the price that we need to
make back the r&d money we had to put in to get through phase three clinical trials
and so from a market perspective this is actually really important if
to make it through a phase three clinical trial to get fda approval to treat disease
with the thing costs a lot of money costs like i have half a billion dollars and to be able to
make that money back if the thing that we studied if the market is paying for it if the thing that
we studied now everybody can sell at the same cost as me i'll never be able to get the r&d
back nobody will fund the r&d so i have to be able to patent the molecule such that i can charge
enough to get the r&d money back to patent the molecule i can't patent things that were part of
your body when it was healthy so i have to look at synthetic molecules that we invent
which means that nowhere in medicine when when we're looking for synthetic molecules are we
studying how a healthy person works or are we studying you when you were healthy before this
thing started or are we studying molecules that were even part of the evolutionary environment
of people we're studying synthetic molecules that weren't part of any healthy person and weren't
part of any evolutionary environment like what's the chance that that's the right way to promote
health it's just wacky right but if we are really trying to study health we're going to find a bunch
of things that we cannot patent and we can't profit off of anywhere near as well and so this
is the example of when you're asking should we do that and what are the odds that guide how should
we go about studying it the perverse incentives built into the market built into not just the
market but the combination between the market the worldview of reductionism the regulatory
processes that are all self-reinforcing has that be the approach and this is why of course despite
all the years of psychiatry and psychiatric medicine mental illness continues to rise
self-harm continues to rise suicidal ideation and suicide continues to rise despite all of the
work in kind of healthcare and pharmaceuticals and the fact that like healthcare is the number one
area of spending for our government and deficit spending and etc obesity continues to rise and
also whole bunches of new autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases and cancers as well
as psychiatric diseases that the curve of the rise of those diseases matches very closely to the
curve of the amount of chemical pollution we put into the environment and agriculture and industry
the american chemical society journal lists 230 million known chemicals and
ever since the environmental movement with silent spring started in the 60s recognizing how
dangerous pesticides were and that they were extincting species and having huge effects
despite all the activity of the environmental movement we've put more total pesticides into
the atmosphere every single year than the previous year and pesticides herbicides etc and you look
at the curve of the rate of like inventing things that are designed to kill the foundation of life
and the foundation of ecosystems with which we co-evolved and spraying them onto the food
supply and into the atmosphere at scale like that's a good idea and and then so if we want to
solve cancer right now that's one of the arguments as to why we need to rush forward with AI so we
can use AI to be able to do genetic engineering immuno oncology to solve these cancers and if you
want to slow down the tech you're a terrible person because look at this little girl with cancer and
would you want her to die but that same technology that gets advanced for that purpose now is cheap
and easy to use for all market purposes and so now you get the bio weapons that it creates
and you get the weird designer babies and the you know all the things all the things the AI technology
does and why is it that the energy doesn't go first to looking at why the cancer rate is raising
everywhere and how to get rid of that which is like mostly an issue of things like chemical
pollution and how we do agriculture yikes so you're you're laying out a story of a lot of things
going wrong but i've heard you talk about this progress narrative and it you know i've there's
there's people like steven pinker who are saying everything's getting better um infant
mortalities way down people's lifespans are longer um the gdp of countries is bigger people are
becoming richer globally is that is that progress narrative is that completely false
it's not completely false it's just mostly false um those stats are largely true as cherry picked
decontextualized stats so the progress narrative is the the idea that everything is getting better
and better through some combination of science technology markets democracy and things like
that that's kind of the version of it in modernity um and there is a regressive history that goes with
it right a habsian view that the state of man in nature right the indigenous people had lives that
were rude is short nasty and mean and that's our you know comparison um this view definitely became
like the dominant worldview in modernity especially because when you do the isot distinction and then
science is the thing that keeps giving you better and better weapons that win war and better and
better ability to increase food supply and grow markets and power and all like that and the other
area is mostly binding and asking you should you do this then of course you this is where you get
niches god is dead because you you know you that's not conferring the advantage anymore and the worldviews
that confer the behaviors that win in war and win in markets are the ones that make it through
and it was a really important point i'll go back to for a moment when you're asking again is a human
nature became theoretic um when throughout history there have been times where they were much more
peaceful cultures and then warring cultures and the warring cultures killed the peaceful cultures
took whatever elements they had turned them into weaponized capabilities and continued on
and when you really study the history of that and you know we can see that in relatively recent time
of like was Tibet a perfect culture before Mao invaded no but were they pretty lovely in a lot
of ways relatively yes were they good at building standing armies not really because the worldview
they had didn't orient itself to that and what happened to them was part of history everybody
knows and the same was true with Native Americans and colonization it's just most people don't if
they haven't studied it don't know the extent of these things the Americas had about 140 million
human beings living here before colonization and the effects of colonization killed 90% of them
and that's a loss of so many ancient languages and systems of music and prayer and medicine
and spirituality and etc if you ask the Native Americans what do they think of the progress
narrative like they they can't believe that anyone would actually believe that seriously
if you ask even if you ask most black people particularly ones who are American descendants
of slaves what do you think of the progress narrative they just don't have the same view on it
obviously right and if you um if you were to ask all of the species that we make extinct and you
know roughly there's somewhere between 10 and 30 species made extinct by human activity every day
how how what they think of the progress narrative or if you ask all the animals in factory farms
it's so obvious that we're talking about progress for a very small number of beings
but let's go back to and a very narrow definition of progress at the expense of
lots of other beings let's go back to this idea of um warring cultures and peaceful cultures
so if you look at the history of the Attila the Huns and Genghis Khans and having the
Terribles and Caesars and Alexander the Great and etc and Maus and Stalin and Leopold's going into
Congo it's a it's a crazy history of humanity Genghis Khan by himself is estimated to have
killed 50 million people in his life him and his people while he was alive not the empire
afterwards just in his life 50 million people which was roughly 11 percent of the entire global
population at the time yes i and that was on horseback i i just read that one in 200 people on
earth are his descendant direct descendant yes yeah it's estimated that somewhere between
eight and 11 percent of Asians are his descendants and so that's because in addition to all the
killing they did a lot of raping and that does mean that the cultures that did not mount as
effective militaries didn't make it through and the cultures that did mount those their ideas their
cultures their etc are what made it through and this is part of that multipolar trap of history
now in general the when king Leopold was going over to the Congo and doing some of the most
atrocious enslavement and murder of the people of the Congo ever to take all their stuff he was
doing it under the guise of it being a humanitarian mission to help the people of Africa and similarly
read all of the quotes about how we were like manifest destiny that it was kind of like
god's ordained divine right for us to take over the united states north america etc and that
it was a generous act that we were civilizing the savages the extent of human motivated reasoning
is really profound the extent to which we believe and try to convince people to believe things that
are directly in our self-interest that are totally ridiculous and somewhere else i want to go that
well yeah you just reminded me of a quote the the worst atrocities are always committed
in the name of virtue you know if you go throughout history at look at Mao and Stalin and Hitler
i mean they all have slogans that say oh we're doing this for the common good you know we're
doing this to help you and they were completely blind i don't think they were completely blind
but they they thought that they were doing good and often the most narcissistic evil person
thinks that their plan for the world is going to create this utopia but really it's they're
ignoring all the mass suffering that they're causing on the way to get it's not necessarily that they
think that it's going to cause utopia it's that they know that is the effective propaganda to
mobilize the people and so yeah this was the thing i wanted to say is
the winner gets to write history and the winner doesn't usually write the history that they were
the bad guys who defected on their agreements with the other side and lied more effectively took
advantage and did the raping pillaging murdering they tell the story that them winning the war was
progress right that the that alexander was uniting all of these disparate tribes and
bringing the world together the genghis was uniting the mongols into you know a great empire that
so the history being written by the winners also leads to a progress narrative and the
wiping out of all the alternative histories of what the cost of that progress was the cost of
that progress was so much of their own culture couldn't be invested in art and spirituality
and child rearing it had to be invested in military activity and conquest and now market
dominance and things like that and the other peoples had to be destroyed and so
the root of the progress narrative is really
in history being written by the winners and in kind of uh at least that's a big part of the story
and then of course in modernity there was a divorcing of the idea that there was much value
in tradition and new insights were particularly going to be how we move forward and so then that
became the dominant narrative rather than embedded within religious narratives
yeah i think a lot of the progress narrative comes down to just do we have more stuff today
are we more comfortable i think that we're so comfortable today that if you asked anybody
would you prefer to live 50 years ago or 100 years ago i i doubt anybody would want to trade
places like it seems nobody with the iphone 15 is going to go back to the iphone one you know
we're just marching forward and so we think the iphone 15 is better than the iphone one
and i think possibly just having more stuff more material that materialist mindset is also
contributing to that progress narrative yeah because we are the people that are the conditioned
result of that thing and we don't know what the life before was like to know what how much we're
missing people who haven't spent a lot of time in deep wilderness
mostly don't know how much happier they would be if they were mostly don't know how many of their
pains and illnesses and psychological disorders would go away how much of the
striving is actually a result of emptiness from living in a environment in which we're
don't have intimate relationships with other people in nature
if you spend time with a indigenous culture and see how much more they understand the language
of all the animals most people aren't aware of how impoverished their life is that they
don't know how to communicate to the animals that they don't know what the whole world around
them is saying all the time and that their mind is never still and quiet and so it's hard to feel
bad about missing something you've never experienced and you don't know exists also when the addict is
coming down they don't want happiness they want a hit of the supply right if somebody's coming down
on heroin they don't want to see a beautiful sunset they don't want a deep conversation with a
friend they they everything else is meaningless because they have created a hypernormal stimuli
that allows them to only get happiness from a very narrow thing it's actually dead in their
