world separate from all other beings around filled with all the things that i wanted that
continuously are re-engaging the what do i want desire kind of ego a complex we're being like
those aspects of self are the ones that are being continuously developed in us even by just
where we are and i find that when i've got to take people into deep wilderness who hadn't
spent much time there and particularly if i get to take a few people where they get to have a really
authentic relationship with each other although there with no game theory no striving no social
status anything and they get to be in um deep nature i find that almost all of their addictive
tendencies drop quickly like pretty quickly they stop wanting to scroll their phone all the time
and most of the productive impulse also starts to drop and that is an unhealthy version of the
productive impulse it's the one that is actually trying to fill an emptiness trying to you know
be somebody it's a whatever be somebody get something but i also find that very quickly
everyone starts to when i ask them get much more at peace with death
in that environment because when you're looking around in nature there's no square foot that
doesn't have death in it there's decaying leaves there's a dead tree there's you know there's death
everywhere but there's life coming out of it and it's all beautiful and it's all interconnected
and there's no clear boundaries between the things because the moss growing on the trees and the
squirrels in it and the fungus on the roots and the and in that and the living in the nuclear
family home separate from everybody else and surrounded by the results of our own acquisition
is conditioning a very different part of self and so this is another interesting thing you know
i said that there's a lot of sociology that was conditioned that was looking at the condition
world and saying it's human nature if most indigenous people are not afraid of death
so you look at Ernest Beck's kind of terror management theory which is very useful in the
kind of civilized world civilized equal domesticated world and
because it's fair to think of the thing we call civilization as a domestication program for wild
sapiens wild sapiens were for hundreds of thousands of years and relatively small tribes
that the idea that everything we do is to avoid fear of death
well you can induce fear of death in people and then in make a world system that induces
more fear of death and then where their desire to avoid the fear of death has them contribute
to that world system but that is again not innate to all forms of human nature
so i got to spend a lot of time in nature when i was a kid
um and so just had a very deep love for the non-human world and uh then a really deep
feeling horrified at the destruction of it and and then yes there were plenty of experiences
in meditation and with uh when you could call psychedelics and with honestly also just being
alone in nature for long periods of time where the intrinsic beauty of every being becomes
forefront and became forefront in my awareness then the fact that every living thing is interconnected
to every other thing right like who am i without plants i couldn't exist without plants they produce
the oxygen that i need to live they produce the calories they you know everything so
and who would i be without bacteria i wouldn't exist who would i be without viruses i wouldn't
exist who would i be without plankton i wouldn't exist so i am an emergent property of all these
other life forms but when i think of myself without thinking of them i can actually advance
my own interests while destroying the things that i actually depend upon without which i don't
even exist i was talking to a friend the other day a new colleague whose work i think is brilliant
her name is venessa andriotti she wrote a book called hospicing modernity you should have her on
and uh indigenous woman and she said that her chief's definition of colonialism and i just
thought this was so beautiful uh was not taking other people's land was not um destruction of
land or land ownership or ownership of people or any of those things that those were all secondary
epiphenomenon that the essence of colonialism was believing that there are separable things
and that all of that other stuff arises out of that optimizing for some things at the expense
of others believing that they're separable and that that's grounded even in something deeper than
belief which is the being conditioned to perceive the world as a bunch of separate things which
happens even the way we teach kids language to name things as nouns there are no nouns right
call a tree it's a noun it's a incredibly dynamic process of billions of biochemical
interactions and biological interactions and physical interactions that give rise to that thing
it's a process right you are a process all the things that you think of as nouns are just
because you're not observing very well and that you think of as separate things could that
does that tree stop at the micro risio or at the you know like uh if you say what is outside of it
it doesn't exist without that all the way down to like is an atom a real thing one atom of hydrogen
well what is the atom without the Higgs field
doesn't exist what is the atom without the electromagnetic field what is the atom without
the strong force what is the so the atom depends upon so much that is not the atom and yet we
ignore that when we define the atom is this we take all the context for granted so then
everything that we care about we pretend is a separable thing and that we can advance it without
understanding all the things it's connected to and we harm the things it's connected to
in the process so both my study of ecology and my study of complexity and my study of
the philosophy of science brought me to this but yes they're also uh and study of history right
but also what you could call spiritual experiences that I think are just called like
clear perception perception that is not totally distorted in which the interconnectedness of
everything with everything else and the uniqueness of everything are both apparent
right that this tree in front of me is completely unique there's not one exactly like it this human
there's like you have experiences and perceptions and life experiences that nobody has ever had and
nobody ever will have exactly like you do and I could actually never know all of that fully
and so when you get that every being is totally unique that means that they're priceless
and and irreplaceable so you can't externalize harm anywhere and all interconnected also means
your fate and the fate of everything you care of is tied up with theirs
I think that you can call it spiritual I think it's scientifically true I think it's philosophically
true I think it's just uh and I think it is what naturally arises in perception
if the mind is not too heavily distorted
you reminded me of one of my favorite lessons from Ram Dass where he talks about how there's two
spiritual ideas that are in conflict with each other that we must hold in our heart at the same time
one is that suffering is endless and your heart has to break for all the suffering in the world
and at the same time you have to see that it's all perfect and those two are completely at odds with
each other but it's very important to be able to see things in both those lights at the same time
and so like oftentimes when people are on rough times I go to the I lean towards the it's all
perfect because I'm trying to show them that this is all part of some higher wisdom that's
training you for a greater purpose and it seems like what you're focused on heavily is the
endless suffering in the world and part of me wants to like zoom out and say hey is this all part
of some greater lesson like are we kind of just killing ourselves like all this um mistreatment
of the earth is really just gonna destroy ourselves you know like we like that quote that you said
earlier from the the chief he said we are not the strand we are the we are not the web we are the
strand in the web and so yeah anything we do to destroy the earth we're just doing to ourselves
anytime you mistreat somebody you're really just mistreating yourself you know hurt people hurt others
it is one of the really deep kind of paradox is to contemplate of the sense of order in the universe
and the kind of perfection in that and the sense of um injustice and atrocity and what is worth
changing and
I remember a time when I was maybe 25 and a woman asked me if I would talk with her daughter
who uh she had recently found out her um husband had been raping for years and her daughter was 15
and um asked if I you know talk with her see if I could help in any way and the
mom hadn't known when she did know she um you know threw the guy out and probably
prosecuted and was trying to help the daughter and in her desire to help the mom had a
you know some kind of new age you could call them views of like everything happens for a reason
and she had been talking with her daughter in the sense of like everything happens for a reason
there's some good in this etc and the daughter came and sat with me the mom left she her arms
were crossed her body was turned away she was just completely shut down and um early in the
conversation she said something like if you're gonna tell me that it's good that this happened
fuck off basically and I said no I'm not gonna tell you that it's good that it happened
I'm gonna tell you that it happened and you it's not your fault that it happened but you
have to deal with it you have to make meaning of it and internalize it and there's different ways
you can do that and you can have a very different life based on how you do that and you can
can hate men forever not trust people feel disgust in your body you know you can do have those
things you can also go through a process that could give you the skills to help lots of other
women process similar stuff um and so that you can process this in a way that leads to a more
whole version of you that we could say is good doesn't mean I'm saying it was good that he did
that it's a difference it's an important distinction to make in that everything is perfect so
I the story I would say any belief that any spiritual or kind of worldview belief that
lessens your empathy I'm not a big fan of and so there's a lot of kind of spiritual
philosophic bypass of suffering because we just don't want to deal with it we don't want to feel
it most of us are avoiding our own suffering right we're avoiding facing really certain very
painful things that happened in our life when we were younger certain aspects of our psyche
that we really don't want to look at or feel and so we don't want to be with anybody else's
suffering because to really feel that we would have to go into those states and we're avoiding it
in ourselves so we want to say everything is perfect or um or you get more of what you focus
on to focus on the positive or whatever it is um I think that the ability to transform trauma
requires the ability to be with it fully to feel it acknowledge it which requires no beliefs that
are trying to bypass straight into um it's just really a good thing it to be with the your own
experience and somebody else's experience and so in general I would say the the spiritual views
that make us more responsible to each other
that make us more aware of how that the only reason we're bothered by stuff the the unnecessary
harm to things is because we love them like I wouldn't care that people I wouldn't feel badly
about the girl being raped if I didn't actually care about her existence it's intrinsic to me
being angry at him or heartbroken about that or the reason that we care about the kids in Gaza
or we care about the animals in factory farm the reason we're angry about it or destroyed or in
trauma about it is because there's something intrinsic to the life of those things that we
know is beautiful that we know is meaningful and that it is some kind of sin that is not
acknowledging it and protecting it right it is some kind of error in perception and behavior
and so you in all the awareness of suffering you can trace it and all the awareness of injustice
in in anybody that we can say man there's a lot of really terrible fucked up stuff in the world
I'm upset about it if I trace back who I'm angry at that did it or what I feel afraid of happening
or what I feel devastated about if I trace it to the source of why I care it's because
those aspects of reality are intrinsically meaningful and beautiful to me and I want to see
them doing well and I want to see them thriving so I think it's important to feel all those feelings
and then to trace them back to their source because the source of all of it is love and that's where
the perfection part comes in but then we also realize that in so far as we have some element
of authentic choice and are not purely automata we can make choices that are more and less in
service of the whole and where we have made and are making choices that are not that in
service of the whole that are not coming from perceiving clearly and adding clearly it's important
to see that and to own it to reconcile it how do we align this uh progress narrative with what's
best for the whole how do we align those two I would say that a meaning for something to be
for a change to be considered progress the total set of effects that come from that change
need to be considered not just the you know like you make a technology and your goal is that the
phone does this thing your goal isn't that child slave labor was used in the drc to make
the nickel or the cobalt for the battery your goal wasn't that all the mining tailing pollution
went into the ocean for to really be considered progress you have to factor all of that and
you have to factor the effects on all the beings are all the beings being effected being affected
through the total set of effects is this still progress and I think if we consider the total
consequences of our choices and we say I want to change the world in ways that are actually
comprehensively considerate of all the effects of those changes that's what I would consider
authentic progress and if it is not considering that it's change and it is advancement of some
narrow thing but it's advancement of a narrow thing that is not progress but regress or worse
for lots of other measures that matter and lots of other beings is it possible to have a solution
without unintended consequences it's possible to do orders of magnitude better than we do now
when the PFOS that is in every drop of water that we mentioned earlier
that has carcinogenic and other types of effects affecting all biology
the chemical the chemical companies that invented it actually did animal trials
that showed that it caused cancer they hid those before it had ever went to market
and ended up bringing it to market after hiding those effects
a similar thing happened with the lead additive in gasoline where it was actually known that it
was toxic studies were repressed propaganda about why it was safe was put forward so so
often we say we couldn't have possibly known and we actually did know and we're lying
other times even like you know when early days of Facebook
now social media gets to say we didn't know it was going to polarize the whole population
and increase teen suicide and body dysmorphia and all those things
guys like Geraint Lanier in 2008 were saying all that was going to happen
right they were like openly leading technologists saying look if you monetize attention you're
going to create shorter attention spans drive addiction and take the most the things that
capture people's attention the most because they don't want to spend all their time on site they
want to get the fuck off line and do other things so to keep their time on site because
of your marketing model and keep them engaging you're going to use more and more salacious
addictive kinds of things and that's going to lead into um tribalism and uh you know negative
emotions being pushed and etc and so there were people saying that at the time they were you know
ignored or said to fuck off and then later we get to say plausible deniability we couldn't
possibly know and it's impossible to anticipate on unforeseen externalities i remember one of the
first times that i was kind of young doing work in environmental science and uh company asked me to
do a risk analysis and so i came up with like all these things that would probably happen that were
really bad if they did it and they were like no no we didn't want this like we wanted you to do
the thing that is industry standard risk analysis where you check a bunch of boxes saying this isn't
going to cause any harm so that we can say we did our due diligence and move forward with
possible deniability and like ah so um could we do a much better job of we're inventing a new
technology and really think through if this succeeds what are the supply chains needed to
create it what is going to happen through the radical increase of all those supply chains
what are the behavioral changes of people using this and what are the likely
effects on psychologies and sociologies if this becomes adaptive what other things is
it now out competing you know like blah blah blah there's a way to think through it we
there's a term called red teaming that many people are familiar with it comes from cyber
security and from military games which is you know you're a bank and you're creating a cyber
security structure you take some of your cyber security guys to be hackers and try to break
into it right they're red teaming they're trying to break the thing that you're trying to build to
see if they're vulnerabilities or you take one branch of you know your own military and have
them try to do a attack against your defense systems so um we came up with a this um non-profit
organization I work with we came up with a related process called yellow teaming which is not the
red teaming is saying how might your project fail yellow teaming is if it succeeds what else might
