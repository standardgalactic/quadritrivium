they would not have come up with the exact same thing they even in those people right they would
have come up with a different set of things because obviously so the amount of innovation in tech
does require innovation in social technology how do we coordinate that well and innovation in
social technology not just that can move faster and be more powerful like deregulation of the
markets and venture capital and stuff but innovation in social technology that is actually aligned with
the viable future what do you what do you think it'll mean to be a human when AI can do everything
better and faster what what's going to be human's roles in this post AI world that's coming
on the primary current approaches to AI I don't think it will be able to do everything faster
and better than humans but it will do lots of things right if you look at LLMs right now
and you talk to them you'll notice that
so your listeners have probably heard the talk of that they hallucinate hallucinates not really
the right term they confabulate they'll make shit up that sounds right but that isn't true
because they don't actually understand right they're not actually understanding concepts at any
in any meaningful way they're looking at statistical relationships between the likelihood of the next word
seeming reasonable to the sentence factoring all of human language and so they'll make sentences
that sound good and if you don't know anything sound reasonable sometimes they're quoting stats
that are completely fabricated you know and made up sometimes the understanding is extremely distorted
um you'll also notice that recombining concepts that exist happens a lot more than anything
like novelty of insight so the the kind of cognitive architectures that are being used
are different in kind than the types of cognitive architectures happening inside of humans now
there are obviously people who are studying how it happens in humans trying to replicate that so
it might go in different directions the direction in which it's currently going um and not just LLMs
but the AIs in general is mostly optimized for near-term maximum market applications so we're
getting very good at using them for weapons targeting for um things like you know some good
things like energy grid distribution type things and solving traveling salesman problems for
supply chains and stuff um but also stuff like making believable ish content at a
unbelievable scale and speed that will become most of all content online very soon that is um
has no actual connection to reality the thing that is generating it has no actual understanding
of reality so that's pretty bad i do so let's but i understand what you're asking which is
if we've already had a bunch of jobs be automated in the past there have been the creation of new
jobs um nobody's all that upset that elevators got automated and that there isn't you know someone
having to be the elevator man because there were new jobs that were created in the process
that automation and just to get a sense like the internal combustion engine tractor
has made it to where there are 150 as many people involved in food production as there were before
so that's a pretty humongous automation of you know human activity with AI some people are like
ah it'll automate a lot of jobs but it'll also make a lot of new jobs and so there won't be job
issue it's fundamentally not true about AI in the same way that it's true about other things because
like the other technologies came from the type of human intelligence that can figure out how to
make a new thing right the internal combustion and the automated elevator came from human
intelligence doing a certain thing AI is actually trying to make the technology of that type of
human intelligence at exponentially more scale that will identify yes it'll create new market
niches but then it will simultaneously figure out how to automate them that's very different
obviously there's a lot of versions of that world that look pretty dystopic and if you advance that
world and you keep capitalism as the underlying system then at least in the past where there was
a need for labor that you had a surf class that had some utility to the elites as opposed to no
utility at all this is also though why some people running AI companies are fans of
some kind of universal basic income is because
the if they're competing for who wins master of the galaxy who will actually own everything and
all of the creative capacity and means of production whatever having the people not rebel is worth
some small amount while they while they increasingly get their needs met in a digital universe that
costs us almost nothing less than a physical universe while they are mostly obsolete and then
that gets packaged as a nicer idea of like oh we'll have this time to pursue creative endeavors and
stuff so you know the good part of the question the good part of the AI question is a thought
experiment is if you could automate all of the tasks that humans do or at least most of the tasks
that humans do what is a meaningful human life and what is unique to what it means to be human
that is not simply task fulfillment that's actually a really good question and
it grounds an experience right we're not building AI's that can appreciate sunsets
we are building AI's that can say words that sound like empathy but are not empathy
the what is you amongst other things one thing that is unique to being a sentient thing as opposed
to just an intelligent thing is the capacity for experience and the capacity for shared experience
and it's definitely true that in the future that i hope for a much higher percentage of
everyone's time will be allocated to things that are in the domain of interpersonal care
so if we could automate a lot of things that humans do and or also make a world system where
so much of the stuff that we do that is totally unnecessary and basically just kind of a racket
we have this is another actual important point i'll take a tangent the multipolar trap in the
same way we said some people will start a company and know that the thing is going to be harmful
lie about it and then when it's found out that it's harmful say it's impossible to anticipate
enforcing things we couldn't have possibly known right so they the fact that it's hard to anticipate
enforcing things is kind of a source of plausible deniability or in a more generous case they don't
know but they don't try really hard to know they don't spend a lot of research dollars looking at
why we shouldn't do this thing because there's the guy who does that doesn't win first mover advantage
and spend all of it on optimizing how to do the thing fastest which is why law has increasingly
you know made corporate personhoods under laws that were made for slavery so that the directors
were protected so the people actually making the choices can't get prosecuted for the activity of
the company and blah blah blah so in the same way that saying what we couldn't anticipate
externalities is usually a lie oftentimes the multipolar trap is a lie we have to because they are
the groups that say that the most or the actual most powerful ones that could create agreements
to change it but also the ones that believe they can win the the people that don't believe they can
win are way more likely to make an agreement to say let's all not do this thing the ones that are
like no i think i can win they'll say we couldn't possibly stop the ai race with you know because
china's going to get there first whatever so we have to be this race we're saying it like if the
us really wanted to stop the ai arms race really really authentically wanted that because they saw
the risk of it saw that was no good for anyone could they do the geopolitical work to get china
to cooperate and then the two of them lead the rest of the world in the cooperation yes i believe so
but the guy that thinks it can win doesn't want to do that and the people that came to power in
the rivalrous context of win the cooperator better at that mode of mind than the other mode of mind
so it's also important to understand that the most powerful players within a multi-polar trap
actually have the power to bind it or change it but they're usually the ones driving it
in which case the argument of the multi-polar trap is largely the justification for their
their own attempt to win
that's a great point about how yeah if you're if you're not in a position to win of course you're
going to make a deal that makes perfect sense so i guess that's very telling if somebody's uh
not willing to make a deal they're uh kind of indirectly revealing their intentions
often and they'll say we're willing they're not willing so we're forced into this while hiding
all of the things that the other side isn't willing because of the way we defected on all of our deals
with them historically or things like that well we've we've gone on for for a good amount of time
but there's still some questions i'd really like to ask you if you have to leave let me know but
but um something i've been really interested in is it seems like our institutions are falling
apart right now or we've got hollywoods falling apart our academic institutions um the mainstream
media government it seems like a lot of these institutions are crumbling and i'm wondering
is this all related is there one common thing that's causing all these to fall apart or
are we just losing faith in our institutions do we need our institutions
is there is there a way to save them
i think i've been the most interested in the the academic
focus of this just seeing the the downfall of colleges and people saying it's not for me anymore
and a lot of young people checking out
i think it's good though i think we need colleges but i think that they're
misaligned with what society actually needs
you want me to talk about colleges or institutions in general um
i guess we could probably start with colleges
let me start by talking about democracy i think that's a relevant frame because the higher order
institutions can textualize or other ones uh you had asked me in the emails democracy ending
um so this is basically the concept of the institution of nation states
being able to be something like you know liberal democracies as opposed to
autocracies or something else um in one way there is a really important critique that democracies
have never really existed that the founding of the us had all of the shitty jobs done by slaves
who had no say in the fact that they did all the shitty jobs obviously women didn't have a say of the
time um and that if people had to democratically vote for the totality of what happened but where
the people who were voting were also responsible for all of the labor uh that that whole system
wouldn't have worked where if they had had to actually pay fair labor that people would have
voted for that wasn't exploited it wouldn't have had the margins to grow the way that it did things
like that um and you see that after the civil war was fought we didn't end slavery because the
peonage system just kind of extended the slavery right the 13th amendment said not shall not be
slaves except as a punishment for a crime so a bunch of fake crimes were made up to be able to
put black people in prison and put them on basically forced labor uh again when that ended
it was largely associated with globalization and the ability to ship the slavery to the third world
so there are more people in indentured servitude or conditions of slavery today than there have
been at any point in the history of the world and we ship most of the cheap labor and really
environmentally harming things whatever to those areas that are a part of the margins of how things
work so calling out democracy is kind of weird um obviously inside of the corporations those are
not democracies those are basically autocracies right which do a huge amount of everything and
the military is not a democracy and etc so there's only a little bit that was supposedly
democracy and it's really hard to say that it was that thing but even in so far as it was
that thing has eroded in some very significant ways that require restructuring of the entire idea set
specifically that was able to happen here in the way that it was and each of the modern democracies
have different but related stories because it was basically the whole continent separated from
any kind of adversaries with oceans and that was a huge part of why certain things were possible
and that you could share with the population things that you wouldn't want to share with
enemies and it wouldn't instantly get to the enemy such that the people could be apprised
of key decisions to make but as technology advanced and telecommunications emerged and
very good ability to spy emerged and the ability to actuate in other places through
missiles and you know things much faster than ships going across the ocean emerged
sharing information with the citizens equaled sharing it with the soviets
right and sharing it with any kind of adversary and so all the things that were of importance to
national security couldn't be shared and increasingly everything started to become an issue of national
security because issues about our water supply and key issues about our food supply and key issues
about what the Fed is going to do with finances and you know etc all start to be increasingly
national security things becoming increasingly classified and how do you do democracy if most
of the most important decisions no one's even allowed to know any of the information about
and yet in a situation of adversaries being able to listen from across the world
and also being able to actuate from across the world how do you share all of the information
that is sensitive to the population this is an issue that democracy faces today that it
did not face in 1776 and um let's take that one a little bit further you know when popper wrote
about open society and that kind of the idea of democracy also went along with the idea of the
open publishing of science everybody could know what was happening in science and academia and
because everybody could be comprehensively educated right that the antecedents for democracy and all
the founding documents was the comprehensive education of everyone and the comprehensive
informanness of everyone so everybody had to have public education everybody had to have a kind of
free and independent news media for the state such that the population could both had the
education to make sense of things and the information to make sense of things such that they could make
good informed decisions we can see that the level of education that the American population has
relative to the complexity of the issues it faces so what understanding of the history of the
israel palestine conflict or ukraine russia dynamics or all the geopolitics involved or
the risks associated with crisper artificial intelligence or the actual condition of
dead zones and oceans like how much of the dynamics regarding that the good regulation
would need just the public understand anything about obviously the complexity of the information
space has increased exponentially and the educational quality as in many ways went down
simultaneously and the news has been you know increasingly uh you know partisanized blah blah
blah so the antecedents for democracy are not in place do you have a population that is educated
enough well informed enough in ways that are not just the propaganda vested interests to be able to
make good choices adequate to the complexity of the choices we need to make in the timescales
like obviously not even close so there is a study i think it was done by braver angels or at least
popularized by them that showed that since the 1970s popular opinion has zero percent correlation
with legislation what the people want has absolutely no effect on legislation that's crazy the
amount of marketing i mean the amount of lobbying dollars has perfect correlation
and so now again we come back to the topic you're asking about captured government so the kind of
core idea of this liberal democracy thing was that the market would naturally get power law
distributions if you just had a pure market you end up getting a situation where some people are
better at making money than others that money is power for everything because that money is like
a unit of game theory right it's like a token that allows you to buy private mercenaries it allows
you to buy marketing it allows you to buy labor tech whatever so if you i need to change the views
of people i need to get politicians on my side i need to build some new technology i need to buy
land money is something that has no intrinsic value but optionality for every type of value
and so everyone started valuing money more than anything else because it represented the
optionality for everything else which is obviously game theoretically relevant
and so some people would be better at making money than others they those who have more money have
more ability to make more money even just through compounding interest compounding interest grows
faster than the general market does this is what piquetti showed in capital in the 21st century
that um in the rich will get richer poor will get poorer intrinsic to the system even if it wasn't
for the fact also that the rich get better education and better health care and better access to
financial services and you know all those types of things so you'll naturally get a power law
distribution where the wealth inequality increases over time until it's so in balance that if you
just had a market like that you didn't have a kind of state then pretty much everybody has no
voice only the people the amount of voice you have to determine the world is proportional to the
amount of money and that ends up really sucking for a lot of things right and there's a lot of
things where there's market incentive to do the thing that you we still don't want to do we don't
want to cut down all the national parks we don't want all of the markets on organs and stuff like
that so we decide now we're going to have a state but we want a minimal state the job of the state
is to serve the collective will of the people including the people who don't have a lot of money
and the state has to be powerful enough to check the powerful forces in the market such
