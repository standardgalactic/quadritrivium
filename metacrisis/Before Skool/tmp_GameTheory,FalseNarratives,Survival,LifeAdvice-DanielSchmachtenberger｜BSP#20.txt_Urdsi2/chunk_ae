are we going to be forced to do that well that's obviously uh one of the dominant stories and
focuses right now is um we are using up all the resources of this planet turning them into
trash and pollution and rather than figure out how to solve that let's just extend that to the
rest of the universe um i think that that's one of the most kind of gross worldviews like so not
beautiful um uh i also think there's no chance that will happen just uh kind of in terms of the
scientific technological curves the time scales at which we destroy this are so much
sooner than the time scales at which we become really effectively interplanetary at the current
rates and so uh whether we are to become interplanetary in the future or not if that
is to be a possibility i think the only chance of that being viable is based on uh getting the
dynamics here right first obviously the you know there's a lot of energy that is going into
us mining asteroids and mining the moon and becoming a interplanetary species
yes i would totally love to see that energy reinvested in creating a viable civilization here
instead the other escape route is uh test realism right is uh AI and programmable matter
and the singularity approach you are actually talking earlier about
is do we have a situation where older people are not actually very useful
to younger people because the rate of technological change in the world is so different in
in so far as if we had a culture that was developing wisdom one it might not
promote all of the technologies um and allow for all of the technologies
one thing that's very interesting is when you look at various definitions of wisdom
they almost always involve the concept of restraint what not to do and which is not a
thing that is really a concept in our market or definitely in all the game theoretic scenarios
so if if we had a culture that was emphasizing wisdom
even if the technological environment changed there's a lot about wisdom that is trans contextual
that would still be transferable we didn't do that but we're also in a situation where the
technological singularity the rate at which technology is increasing is such that even young people
can't keep up with the rate of it and so Kurzweil's idea of the singularity the rate at which
technological change is so fast that by the time you're adapting to a new technological change
it has already been obsolete and the new technologies that are the most dominant
are coming out faster than humans can adapt so humans are no longer adaptive in the
technosphere the rate of information creation is such that no one can be an expert on anything
because there's more information being created than anyone can know in some ways we've already
passed the information and technological singularity and so the answer that uh
unfortunately most of the money of the world is following right now is accelerationism
is we're in this multipolar trap we can't stop it so the only thing that could possibly
we're not smart enough to understand all that and to adapt fast enough so maybe an AI will be
so whoever builds the first AGI is going to be what runs everything maybe whoever is the one
that builds it either because they can do a brain computer interface or they can do a whole brain
emulation upload of their consciousness to the cloud or because they can keep the AI working
for them or something they will have that kind of first mover advantage and so if you look at
you know Microsoft is a three trillion dollar company which is amazing right that means that
their market cap is more than the GDP of almost every nation in the world and if you look at the
top like 11 companies right now seven of them are basically have AI as their main play and
so you have all these trillions that are invested in the U.S. have to be the Chinese
at AI supremacy and the Chinese have to be the U.S. the various companies are all competing for
AI supremacy and it's and you'll see Sam Altman make jokes like oh it'll probably kill everybody
but it'll make a lot of shareholder profit in the meantime like openly make those jokes and there's
this weird world we live in where people are like okay let's just keep kind of going with that and
so the other answer to this that is being pursued that I think is even crazier than all right so
we destroyed this planet let's get off and get the other planets is let's create a digital god
that can solve all the problems and even if our creation of it risks absolutely everything
and is driving all the problems to be worse in the process
oh boy
it seems like these problems and these issues are so large that myself and the average person
it's just like it's too big for us to even wrap our minds around so we might as well just keep
living keep following our impulses you know like how do you get people to care about these
massive existential crises when their own personal problems are so much more urgent and real
they're not a few years ago the people in Kiev thought their normal day-to-day issues were
the most critical thing that obviously changed for them very rapidly
Kiev was a very progressive city people a lot of people in the blockchain community were moving
there because it was one of the places that was like a hub for decentralized computing
we and you know Israel was one of the most kind of technologically economically advanced places
and we see the dynamics that are happening there collapse can start to come to a place
it's so easy if we're not in the place where collapse is happening
to think that it won't ever happen because we don't have an experience of it so we don't have
an intuition for it even though the history is that every empire in the history of the world
collapsed that right before it collapsed it was usually at a tight that the people at that time
didn't think it was going to happen so they weren't doing any smart kind of guidance or
preparation they were continuing to live in the way that advanced what caused it to collapse
directly so we can be more foresightful than that it would be nice if we were more
foresightful than that and i'm saying that the timelines of the issues facing the world are
such that if people are paying attention right now they will realize there are things that are
much bigger issues than the things you're dealing with in your current life that are impending
that orient really deep life reconsideration the next thing is this is if if people haven't
everybody should go study the ash conformity studies in the milgram experiments which
you know i'll just recap very briefly milgram experiments fascinating behavioral psych done
at stanford where people were brought into the part of a scientific experiment they were told
that the experiment had to do with the effects of like electroshock therapy on people there's a
person on the other side of the wall who was going to be receiving a shock they just had to push the
button of the level of shock the scientist was monitoring and the what they were trying to do
is understand the effect of electric shock the reality was the person pushing the button was
the test case the person on the other side of the wall that they couldn't see he wasn't actually
hooked to electric shock they were an actor and every time the button was pushed they you know made
a noise accordingly but the people in the study obviously didn't know that that's why the study
worked and so the scientist the authority in the situation said okay go ahead and do the shock at
this voltage and the they'd hear on the other side a groan and then they turn the voltage up and
say now do it and then turn the voltage up and the person screams on the other side and the person
who's pushing the button is like is this okay are they all right over there and the scientist
like yes everything is okay this is what we have to do is for science and a humongous percentage
of the people continued to push the button because the authority told them to to the point that they
actually believed it was killing the person on the other side and the ash conformity studies are
where a whole group of people were all tested together about which line is longer and they'd
put a few lines or which color is darker or something like that and everybody in the group
was an actor except one but the that one person didn't know that they thought everyone else was
part of the study everyone else said this line is longer but it was obviously false right like
the other line was longer and a very high percentage of people
had their answer match with what the group said some people had their answer go against what the
group said even when the group said the right thing because they were disagreeable so rather than
actually observe reality themselves a lot of people either went with the group or disagreed
with it as the basis of their action but went with it was particular interest so going with
what the authority dynamic is going with what the kind of group dynamic is
so when the Nazis were being tried in the Nuremberg trials for war crimes this was one
of the most fascinating things because like how when we were talking about population wide
dispositions the Germans were not always genocidal people right and so it's like how did
it happen that relatively quickly a population of people who were moral human beings who loved
their children who you know were normal normal people were now at mass throwing kids in gas chambers
and when when they were asked did you believe that everything you were doing was good
90% of the Nazis said no they said at first we did but we were just bringing the people to the
camps who weren't going to exterminate them and etc and it got worse and worse and worse
and by the end like no we didn't think it was good and then they were asked did you try to stop and
all of them said no we didn't try to stop and when asked why they all quoted the same German
phrases that translate to officers orders I didn't really have a choice when people don't
feel like they have a choice they can be complicit with evil even if they are not actually evil
when people say there's nothing I can do about the world situation it's the same thing but rather
than the Nazis it's the distributed system that they're being complicit with all right well I'll
just keep doing all the things that the system is disposing me to do buying all of the things that
I want on Amazon having them delivered to my door and pursuing the cultural status things
that marketing tells me to pursue and etc rather than unplug from that thing and say the Christian
emergency quote that it's not a good measure of mental health to be well adjusted to a profoundly
insane society if my society is causing the extinction of 10 to 30 species every day
if it is increasing the chemical pollution to the point that everybody's becoming infertile and
having autoimmune diseases and cancers and neurodegenerative diseases if it is rapidly
building the most horrifying kinds of weapons possible in arms races is that a sane society no
it's a fucking batch hit crazy society do I want to be complicit with it am I willing to be complicit
with it am I willing to have my spot in the history of the world be at the time when human choice
mattered more than any other time because previously you could have the fall of a roman civilization
or the fall of the ottoman or the fall of the egyptian vast civilizations but it still wasn't
everything they were still local civilizations and you did have civilizations that actually fell
because of environmental overreach that was actually quite common and the over stripping the
environment in your civilization failing is a multi thousand year old story so you can read books
like the collapse of complex civilization by joseph tainter to show one of the reason civilizations
collapsed they cut down all of the trees the topsoil would erode they would lose agricultural
capability and then they'd stop being able to feed the people so we've been you know iceland used
to be covered in trees there's no trees the vikings destroyed all the trees the thing that we think
of as iceland is not iceland it's iceland post deforestation um some of the great deserts of the
world were the results of early human activity that desertified them and so but when we destroyed
the environment it was always just a local environment it wasn't the biosphere right it wasn't
the chemistry of the oceans writ large the atmosphere the amount of genetic integrity of
how many species of soil microbes there are things like that there's a study that came out
about six months ago on PFOS the fluorinated surfactants which are basically like you know
rain ex and scotch guard and the stuff that we spray on everything
that PFOS is found in rain water everywhere in the world it was found in freshly fallen snow
and Antarctica it's found in rain water on every continent that means there's just there's just one
category of pollution that we have made so ubiquitous that if you're off-grid collecting
rain water to try to not be part of the system it's filled with PFOS and it was at
PFOS that was at many times higher than the EPA allowable levels everywhere in the entire world
that's having biological effects not just on humans the infertility things but on the soil
microbes on the algae on the on everything right on the whole planet so if you see that we're at a
time where we could that the the precedent of history is its civilizations end and they end
for reasons that they helped cause they end for reasons that had to do with self-termination
and even if you say well they were beat by someone else usually it was also that they
engaged in rivalry that engendered those types of dynamics with the other people and oftentimes
they got large enough that they got internally infighting and erosion of how their government
worked because of corruption and things like that many of the civilizations that fell to an
opponent fell to opponents smaller than ones that they had successfully defeated earlier because
they had already went through internal decay so the precedent is civilizations end they play
their own growth plays a major role in their own end but for the first time in history we have a
single global civilization where all of the products we depend on take six continent supply
chains to make there is no chinese civilization and us civilization and all the us stuff depends on
chinese stuff depends on cobalt that comes from the drc in africa depends upon oil that comes from
the middle east come you know etc and so all the manufacturing of our needs comes from a global
civilization that is in the same process of self-termination it doesn't have to go that way
we could go a different way with it you can imagine that none of the nazis wanted to defect
because if they defected the idea was they would be killed right if they could coordinate and all
defect then there wouldn't have been the genocide in the first place the ability for people today
to realize that the trajectory of the world that we're on is not the trajectory that they want
that they are not willing to be complicit with that the possibility of changing it is a more
potent possibility for meaningful contribution than anyone has ever had in terms of scale
and that that's a more worthy use of their life and attention than whatever is currently engaging in
that i think is the only sane assessment
i love everything you just said and i'm i'm wondering is this a privileged world view though
like it's hard to go to somebody in a developing nation who's burning fossil fuels just to stay
warm or you know they're it's it's hard to go there and say hey just stop fishing you're over
fishing here when they're start they're just trying to survive you know we've built our civilization
up to a point where we don't have to we're not living in that survival mindset um Jordan Peterson
his theory is that you got to make everybody rich and then they start to care about the environment
what do you think about that idea um
indigenous people who
didn't use didn't even have fiat systems of money all cared about the environment
so like that's a um there's so many of our thoughts on sociology that are looking at
ubiquitous conditioning post industrialization and because it's ubiquitous conditioning certain
dominant systems one then we do all of our social studies on these people that were conditioned
this way and then we call it human nature and if we were to look at indigenous people that were
of course how everybody was for all of human history and there's a lot of variants in it
they fall outside of all of the sociological bell curves but we just call those statistical
outliers are so do you have to be rich to care about the environment no is it harder to care if
you are in abject poverty yes indigenous cultures weren't in abject poverty they didn't have a lot
of surplus but they had a relationship with a they were able to provide for themselves in
relationship with nature in a way that was sustainable poverty is actually a result of
the thing we call civilization that's actually a really important point is when you
start to create large cities right Sumeria Babylonia Egypt etc the early empires
now you have a scenario where people are being trained in specialist activities so that you get
division of labor and more total things happening so people have are all dependent upon this overall
system and no one has self-sufficiency or even small scale like tribal sufficiency
and that system is in a process of unrenewable unsustainable growth and game
theoretic dynamics with other places and so you know before colonization Africa was not a place
of rampant poverty right Africa was a place of rampant poverty after colonization after
destroying the people's cultures kind of enslavement environmental damage moving people from the
arable land they were in you know so many things like that and so it's so that logic itself is
actually part of the perpetuation of the existing system that says okay you have to have everybody
grow up in in the economics of this system well if you tried to give everyone in India
