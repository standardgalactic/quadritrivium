Okay Daniel it's great to see you. Very good to see my friend. Been looking forward to this
conversation. This is the big one. I've been looking forward to this one for quite some time
and I have to say I spend a lot of my time looking into deep thinkers and philosophers
and theories and I have to say that your ideas are some of the deepest I've come across.
So I'm going to try to keep up but I'm really excited to dive deep today.
I've been so impressed with the translation that your videos have done of a number of really great
thinkers making it so much more engaging and digestible for people so respect is mutual
and I'm happy to be here and see what comes. Thank you. So we're going to talk about the
meta crisis today and some other things. So before we begin on that conversation I thought that
maybe something that would inform the rest of the conversation would be to define game theory
because I've heard you mention that quite a bit. Yeah formally game theory is a branch of
mathematics that studies how to make the optimal strategic choice under uncertainty
to win a game starting with in two player zero sum games like chess or the Cold War
and it was formalized kind of in the World War II era. There was a book written by von Neumann,
the great physicist, mathematician, thinker and a guy named Morgenstern on game theory and economics
and it's interesting that it was those two together because so much of how our economic
system works is based on the same concepts. Game theory has been happening forever it wasn't called
game theory it's just called strategy right it's just we hadn't been able to apply some of the tools
of math and computation that were able to be applied at that time but if you're reading Sun Tzu or
you're reading Machiavelli or you're reading any kind of general discussing military strategy
they're basically talking about how do you win a rival risk game where you don't know what the
opponent is doing and where obviously depending upon what they're doing some moves would be great
moves some moves would be terrible moves obviously this is chess this is any kind of game dynamic
like that. So there's a the most famous first study in game theory that many people have heard of
is the prisoner's dilemma and I won't describe the prisoner's dilemma in detail here people can
check it out online but the idea is you and a buddy are both in jail you're both being investigated
you're both being given a kind of plea type option if you both cooperate with not kind of ratting
each other out it's the best solution for both of you but if the other guy rats you out and you
don't it's the worst solution for you personally and if you end up ratting on the other guy and
he doesn't it's less bad for you than if you both kind of keep the dynamic in. So what is found out
is that under the uncertainty where you don't know what the other guy is going to do the tendency
is to assume the worst and move into a position of kind of maximum selfishness maximum rivalry
and you can imagine in situations of warfare if you don't know how much armament the other guy has
you don't know how aggressive their interests are you want to assume the worst case scenario
and try to plan to be able to win under the worst case scenario which ends up meaning and the other
guy is doing the same thing if let's say they're offering an agreement but you know they might
defect on their agreement which happens all the time right Stalin and Hitler were participating
when it was serving both of their interests and then uh Hitler defects on Stalin when it's not
aligned to this interest so in game theory there's something called a coordination game which is
you actually don't compete against someone you coordinate with them when it's in your
interest to coordinate but then you reserve the right to defect on them when that's in your interest
and not just in military situations you see that in uh say class dynamics the upper class might all
coordinate with each other with regard to tax policies for the upper class while simultaneously
competing for who has positions of maximum power within that class uh a whole industry like say the
ai sector or oil might coordinate with each other for getting the regulations they want for the
sector while then all competing for who has the most market share so under a game theoretic
scenario there is no such thing as allies for real there there is no such thing as like friends
or loyalty there's frenemies at best and the frenemy scenario is as long as we have shared
interests i can expect a certain degree of cooperation as soon as we don't have shared
interests i can expect defections or continuously planning for selfishness and defection and
that takes up also a huge amount of bandwidth this ends up explaining a tremendous amount about
how the world works uh militarily economically politically diplomatically where we're making
an agreement while assuming the other guy will defect while they are assuming we will defect
we're trying to figure out how to spy on their defection while being able to confuse their spies
you know like and those types of dynamics are a huge amount of the coordination failures of the world
and there are some things that uh game theory and game theoretic thinking even before it was
formalized in math the formalization of it just made it much more powerful and much more
ubiquitous and now you can run it on computers and run it on ai so we can see ai being able to
run those types of models beats humans at chess beats humans at go beats humans at starcraft
now is increasingly beating humans at more generalized things like obviously trading
economic trading and uh even uh comprehensive war planning and targeting of missiles and all those
things um so one type of game theoretic scenario that defines a lot of properties of the world is
if there are a number of players number of actors let's call it tribes or countries or companies
or whatever and one of them does something that provides a lot of near-term advantage for them
it might be doing something particularly destructive like say let's take a early kind of
tribal analogy rather than only taking what they need from nature they're starting to cut down a
lot more timber to be able to create surplus and you have a scenario where that they can then use
that surplus in different ways to be able to win a tribal warfare so now you take the other tribes
if they don't do the same thing it doesn't protect the forest because the other guy's going to cut
down the forest anyways and but and if they don't do the same thing they might not even be able to
protect their people and so now even if they didn't want to they have to race to cut down the forest
faster just for their own need to survive and so you get the scenario where there's kind of a race
to exploit the commons and whether that's fishing or hunting or you know any kind of exploitation
from the environment or oil so you have a situation called the tragedy of the commons
which is a kind of social trap is one of the terms or multi-polar trap where
the net scenario of what everyone is racing to do makes the worst possible world for everyone
but nobody can stop it because if anyone stops it's so much worse for them in the short term and
they can't assure that the other guy's not going to do it and so the idea that because they are
doing it we have to you end up having a world that nobody wants but nobody feels they can choose
otherwise and this is such a deep thing to understand because like let's say you take
any of the major environmental issues of the time I'm going to take climate change because
probably most of your listeners think that's a thing for those who don't you can apply it to
species extinction or chemical pollution or any of these issues
literally nobody actually wants climate change like there's no one for whom climate change is
their strategic objective and yet and the whole world actually in terms of the G20 the United
Nations all of the major countries of the world have acknowledged climate change is a major issue
we all want to stop it there's a trillion dollars in climate related funding happening every year
there's the IPCC having huge supercomputers supported by NASA and NOAA there's international
agreements and yet every single year we use more fossil fuels in the year before
all of the renewables all of the solar all the everything we haven't even slowed the rate of
increase of fossil fuel use and so we obviously don't know how to stop climate change everybody
thinks that it's a particularly bad thing the UN estimates that about a billion refugees from
extreme weather events and climate change will happen in the next decade and the world has no
way to deal with a billion refugees and so we can't stop it and yet nobody wants it what they want
is energy for every other purpose and that's one of the side effects of it and no one feels that
they could price energy properly or be able to consume less because let's say the US priced
energy properly meeting it right now we price oil as how much it costs us to extract it from
the ground plus a tiny margin not what it took nature to make or what it would take for us to
clean up the environmental effects so obviously most of the costs are externalized to the environment
if we were to start to try to price it more properly so that you could produce it in a way
that didn't have the negative environmental effects but say China didn't then they would have more
margins than us they would beat us that's the multipolar trap and the same happens in arms races
the advancement of you know military tech if if they're making AI drone weapons and the AI drone
weapon is going to comprehensively outperform the ones the weapons that are run by humans then we
have to make a drone weapons and if we don't know exactly what type they're making we have to assume
we have to spy on them obviously and we have to run counter intel on their spies but we also
have to assume that they're making all of the worst possible ones plus defenses and try to
get comprehensive advantage allocate larger and larger military budgets and you get a world in
which there is increasing destructive power with nuclear weapons cyber weapons hypersonic
delivery of nuclear weapons drone weapons etc and again literally nobody wants to live in the world
with AI drone weapons but also no one feels that they can stop it and so this multiplayer
game theoretic dilemma where under uncertainty you assume the worst case scenario you race ahead
the net result is this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy is the other guy it does do that thing
whether he was going to or not because he thinks you're going to and you're saying the only reason
you are is because you think they are and the world you end up getting is maximum environmental
destruction maximum weapons maximum distrust etc yeah it reminds me of a story where a town has no
lawyers so there's no lawsuits and then it has one lawyer and there's still no lawsuits and then it
gets two lawyers and all of a sudden everybody's suing each other so it's kind of like i don't
need a security guard unless you have a security guard and then it's i'm wondering is this just
built into human nature this this issue
no and the reason you can say no kind of confidently is because there are examples
of groups of humans who bound these kinds of social traps effectively for periods of time
which means human nature is capable of doing that thing human nature is obviously capable
of doing this thing and obviously very well but it's not that human nature obligately does it
it's the human nature under conditioning environments does it so this is a this is a very
important thing to understand about human nature let's take a look at the janes right the eastern
religion that emphasizes non-violence more seriously than most do so much so that they
really go out of their way to never hurt a bug if they're going to build a house they remove all
the bugs first so they don't hurt any bugs they um eat fruits and nuts that fall from the plants
but they won't even kill plants to eat them the existence of the janes has you know decently large
populations over long periods of time mean that you can have not just a particularly nonviolent
person but a whole culture of people that all get inculturated to live that way so human nature
allows janes right as one example but then you can also look at say the janjuid and uh
child you know child soldier utilizing demographic in sudan where by the time someone gets to
puberty pretty much everyone has murdered people and in that environment if you don't
participate with that thing you don't make it to puberty and so again you have a situation in which
you can have the entire population um i'm sorry someone knocked oh it's all good um so we were
talking about the janes and then scenario where yeah what's that oh so we were talking about the
janes and then we were talking about child soldiers yes so you can have populations that have
radically different distributions of how violent or how nonviolent people are you can have populations
where the level of education is radically different even independence of the economics
when you look at say the jews in the pogroms in russia the way they invested in the education of
the kids even in positions of like you know near slavery and total poverty there was a culture
kind of dynamic so human nature it's a very important thing to understand about human nature is that
unlike all the other animals because of our capacity for toolbuilding
we didn't stay limited to one niche that our bodies had evolved to be able to work well in
the cheetah is amazing for one niche it would do very bad in the arctic and the polar bear would
do very bad in savannah so they stay in their niche right but you notice that humans moved everywhere
and humans ended up becoming like the apex predators everywhere because they were able to
put on skins and build houses and change their tooling set so that they could be adaptive and
actually apex predator and then environment dominating in all the spaces so if you look at
the life of a cheetah or a polar bear today versus a cheetah or a polar bear 10 000 years ago
in their natural environment what makes them adaptive is pretty much the same thing so they
get to have kind of built-in genetic code nature for how to be that thing that co-evolved with their
environment and co-evolved with their body but what it means to be an adaptive human today
versus 10 000 years ago or even 50 years ago is totally different most people today are not awesome
at spear throwing even though that was a super useful skill we're very good at texting and other
things so because we change our tooling stack change our languages change the environments we're in
change the types of political economies we're in we have to change our nature we have to change
deep aspects of how we perceive the world how we make sense of the world and how we behave
so a key aspect to humans is a profound amount of plasticity because we change our environment so
much we have to kind of get rather than hardwired kind of like software adapted to the unique
environments that we're in which is also part of why human children are kind of incapable of
self dynamics right they're called neoteness embryo like for so long horses up walking in
20 minutes it takes a human child a year to be walking because they don't come with the built-in
imprint because they're going to have to learn a language they're going to have to learn all of
these things right and as a result human nature is very radically plastic so if we want to look
environments where there were tribes that were not only relatively more peaceful within the tribe
but relatively more peaceful between the tribes we can see those examples we can see them in the
Iroquois Confederacy we can see them in examples of um inter-tribal agreements in the aborigines
where they didn't define things via multipolar traps they uh came into inter-tribal councils had
conversations had agreements kept the agreements had enforcement that worked so uh is it in is it
human nature that we can do game theory yes is it human nature that we must know but when someone
else starts doing it it becomes obligate to do it or lose and this is kind of the key thing
so it's not human nature it's system dynamics that make it obligate so there's a whole bunch of
things that we think of as human nature because they're happening everywhere because they're
ubiquitous conditioning because they became obligate and so this this is such an important
example so you know there are on your show in particular there are people that can test how
long humans have been around but the standard narrative is sapiens have been around two to
300 000 years a pretty long time and for all of that time standard narrative we were uh
hunters and gatherers right pre having the plow in all the hunter gather cultures around the world
from what we can tell they were pretty much all animistic
and anytime there's something that occurs everywhere it's a bit it's an interesting thing
right it means it's kind of a property of evolution that arises it is something closer
to like nature what is animistic mean they were related to the spirit of everything the spirit
of the tree the spirit of the buffalo the spirit of the river the spirit of the moon and so animism
is the idea that everything is animated by the great spirit in some way and has their own kind
of unique spirit to them so if you study any kind of indigenous culture the way they would
okay we're gonna hunt a buffalo and we will actually cry when we kill the buffalo we'll
make prayers we will say that when our body goes into the ground when we die it'll become the grass
that their ancestors will eat in the great cycle of life but there's a respect for the spirit of
the buffalo right so when we figured out the plow kind of the ox drawn plow we had to figure out
how to take a buffalo domesticate it castrate it yoke it and you know whip it all day to do that
thing you couldn't continue to be animistic and you had to move into worldviews that were like
man's dominion over nature the animals were put here to serve us man was made the you know king
of the kingdom that kind of thing whereas the chief seattle quote we are not the web of life
we're merely a little strand and that whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves those are very
different worldviews but you can't run the plow and be animistic and not only that but because the plow
allows you to do this long row cropping which of course if i'm if i'm gathering i'm not going
to get anything like that to do the long row cropping i need a lot of land allocated agriculture
