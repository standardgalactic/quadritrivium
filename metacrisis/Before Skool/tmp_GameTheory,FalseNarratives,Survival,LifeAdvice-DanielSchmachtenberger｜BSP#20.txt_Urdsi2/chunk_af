and Bangladesh and China and Nigeria a US or UK quality of life in terms of resource consumption
per capita you there is no way to do that we are already past ecological tipping points
with already that not being the case and so I'm not putting the burden of thinking about
how to change the world system on the people who were put into poverty by the world system
most of your listeners are probably not in this place many of your listeners might feel that
they're working hard to pay the bills but they also probably when they get a chance increase
their cost of living um in a way and you know continue to increase their cost of living as
they're capable of producing more such that their time stays bound to uh you know money making and
such that they continue to feel that they have to work and be part of the system all the time
but you know one of the gifts in my life was I don't know I think some mentors told me this
early was I kept my cost of living extremely low such that I kept the amount of my time allocated
to supporting my existence very low so I got to have most of my time allocated to studying the
world that I was in and thinking about what was meaningful and engaging in it in a way that was
not um market bound I want to say something about progress yes yes
if you think about
human life depending upon
all of these species and this biosphere and these this ecosystem that took
kind of billions of years of evolution
the amount of work that nature put into creating a world that we can exist in
is mind-blowing right like the amount of if you want to call evolution the amount of like
design and iteration and work that had to happen to get a world that we can exist in is mind-blowing
it's reasonable that a huge percentage of our attention would go to maintaining and protecting
that as opposed to just the topic of advance if advancement is much more interesting than maintenance
advancement is much more interesting to egos in particular
to uh you know the things that we get to take credit for very few people make the history of
book for maintaining the world um but most of life should actually be about maintenance
and you look at the I mean this is a key part of the division of labor between men and women is that
in householding feeding the kids you wash the dishes and they get dirtied and then you wash
them and then they get dirtied and you make food and then it gets eaten and you make food and it gets
eaten and so you don't actually get to make the history books for that and yet it's the foundation
of everything and um so I think a huge part of a healthy culture puts an incredible value on
maintaining and stewarding the unbelievable gift that existence is and realizing that it takes
work to maintain and steward and so progress is actually not the main focus the main focus is
actually appreciation of what is and honoring and relating to what is well maintenance on the
doing side is a huge amount of the activity obviously all the examples we're giving where we
made progress that caused harm other places is not doing that right it's causing radical harm to
in a very small number of years and decades to what took nature billions of years to make
and when we make a species extinct that was the result of billions of years of evolution
we make them extinct quickly and we can't ever get them back and if we destroy a culture where
their language took thousands of years to evolve and they're you know then they're gone forever it's
it takes a long time it takes decades to grow an adult human being but you can kill them in
a second destruction is fast um and as a result maintenance and protection should be a very high
value because you can also grow things fast that are also destroying other things that are outside
of the field of where your market incentive or what your you know purview of your jurisdiction what
you're supposed to be focused on is it's not just market incentive it's I remember one of the first
times I started engaging with kind of government organizations my very early 20s talking to people
the world food program about how to solve world hunger and they had an approach that brought NPK
based agriculture to the developing world and did a whole lot more agriculture in those places so
that you didn't just have to ship food to them and I said that approach will accelerate the dead
zones in the oceans very rapidly which will accelerate the uninhabitability of the entire
planet and they said that's right I guess that's true we hadn't thought of that but ultimately
oceans are not the metrics we're tasked with the metrics we're tasked with are how many people
were feeding per year right now and so like so it's not just the perverse incentive of the market
it's also the choice making architectures that divide the world into parts and think you can
optimize a part without thinking about its relationship to everything else in the universe
that's actually radically more interconnected than that the other thing is not only did this world
take so much to create that we want to maintain but also to just enjoy and appreciate a meaningful
human life has a lot of time just in awe of sunsets and trees and animals and children and stars and
and if the goal is to make stuff better to make stuff better to make stuff better to and it never
grounds in the actual experience of the beauty of what is who cares right so a huge percentage of
right life should not be oriented to progress but actually taking in and like all and gratitude
the beauty of what is so much of our progress impulses because we don't have that and so there's
an emptiness that wants to fill itself with the addictive hit of progress right I I'm getting ahead
I'm growing I'm getting better I'm inventing a new thing I'm you know whatever and a lot of the
progress impulse is pathological result of emptiness now there is a healthy type of progress
it's also important because taking in the world as it is that mode of being is the foundation
it's the foundation of why anything matters at all is because we actually have experience the depth
of our experience of the meaningfulness of life is why anything matters to then want to protect
maintain or add to but we are also created beings and we want our creation to add to the beauty of
the world so first we need we want to take in the beauty of the world we want to protect and
maintain it and then we want to add to it but where it really adds to it right add to meaning
that in harmony with all that is otherwise it's not going to add to it it's going to
you know add something and destroy other things and it may be destroying things that are more
fundamental and more meaningful and so it is important that we have a sense of progress
that comes from a depth of being and fullness so that we're not trying to get all of our
havingness from progress there's there's also so much about the way kids are raised
where them learning more is where they get their rewards and them you know gaining new
it's the combination of that with you know they're progressing in their studies as the main
place of where they get their reward with not enough depth of real intimacy and unconditional love
that creates a doing over being emphasis right another part of that that's so significant is that
in most kids growing up most of the times they were rewarded was for doing something somebody
else wanted them to do doing something that the teachers parents wanted them to do and getting
an answer other people had already figured out and most of the times they were punished or told
they were wrong were for answers that made sense to them or things that their own sensibility wanted
to do and so if you want to train ash conformity into everybody and you know mill room conformity
and everybody that's a good way to do it it's not a good way to train people how to actually think
how to discover and how to make good choices on their own where was i right before this i
wanted to come back we were talking about schooling and incentives and maintenance rather than
progress ah yes so if
marshal Rosenberg admitted non-mine communication with someone i got to study with and it's so
beautiful to watch him talk about how he worked with kids in how he taught kids he said when the
when i'm teaching kids say math and the kid gets what we would call the right answer
i don't praise them for getting the right answer and i don't punish them for getting the wrong
answer we just talk about the right and wrong answers independent of their kind of sense of
validation so like a kid rushed to the front of the classroom as the first one finishing a
math assignment could tell that he rushed to the front of the classroom and was the fastest one
because his parents or whatever had been ingraining the you know you need to get all the right answers
and be the fastest at it and rather than say oh look you got them almost all right and one wrong
good job you got a 99% but then also the pain on the one wrong marshal looks at it and says
you know i get the same answer as you for all of these ones except this one i got a different
answer on this one can you walk me through how you got that one and the kid self corrected it
and said okay we got the same answer on all of these cool but then has a deep expression of the
love of the kid when he sees what they are like their authentic self expressing itself not just
them getting the right answer on things because then that kid might start to love math even though
they don't really love math just because they figured out how to get reward circuits on it
um so
the type of progress that comes from a sense of fullness of what is and desire to
appreciate protect maintain and add to what is is a much healthier one than the one that
comes from the desire to fill an emptiness then it is important that we can act that we actually
believe that we can have the activity of our life leave the world better for others
that's the authentic meaningful part of the progress narrative that i
i've got to experience a tremendous amount of beauty i want to leave the world at least
as beautiful not worse and ideally more beautiful for others and that's such an important sacred
impulse that i want to rescue that from the propagandized version that says because you
grew gdp or because you got a new product or market out there um you know a product to market
or because um you know some new piece of technology was advanced even if it's used to
destroy lots of things that that's progress it's the reality of what authentic progress would be
which is i actually left the world better better requires meaning we can say something about good
and ought not just is and better for whom a more inclusive definition that includes everybody
future generations not just my people but all people not just people but other beings
and a deeper definition of what is actually meaningful which is going to ground in the
basis of the depth of experience and so i want a world where people feel that they can add to
progress where there is something sacred about the way we think of progress and because it is so
sacred a bastardized version of it is totally not okay right the bastardized version of it
is a sin it's like no no the idea that we are unbelievably gifted to exist in this world at all
we want to honor and protect that and that we were endowed with creative capabilities we want
to use those creative capabilities to leave that kind of gift for others that i actually want
people to hold how sacred that that progress impulse is and make sure that all the ways they
add to the world actually meet that definition i know there's so many ways i want to go with
this conversation but i'm i'm curious to know how you came to these ideas we're like psychedelics
a part of your mind expansion or meditation like what what brought you to this way of thinking
i'm not trying to derail us on this conversation but it seems like there's a like a spiritual flavor
to some of the things and i'm wondering where that came from
many different things i'll say a few
one thing that was really a very fortunate experience when i was a kid
my mom took me to do a lot of activism work of many kinds and volunteer work and one
the types of volunteer work was we'd go to uh old folks homes and spend time with the people
there and just talk and listen to their stories and um and particularly we'd find people who didn't
have family members who were coming to visit and kind of adopt them as grandparents and visit them
often sometimes bring them over to the house and um and i i got to have the experience of being with
people who were literally on their deathbeds and shared their deathbed reflections many many many
times as a you know as a young kid and that was super impactful um because there were patterns
that the people shared that were very noticeable and they said roughly like
there's a way that i'm reflecting on what was meaningful now that death is eminent that i
never could before because before i was always still focused on the obligations of what i had to
do next and what i still wanted to do so i was not purely backwards looking and so i didn't go as
deep into that and as i don't have a chance to do any more things in the future and i'm just
reflecting on what was most meaningful you know their insights that come up and um
um you know there are lots of uh articles that say number one regret of the dying that
different people have um have said different things and it has a lot to do with the questions you
ask that frame them but as i as i was there listening the one that stood out the most by far
of the regret of the dying was that they didn't express their love to everyone around them enough
but they were like i you know i so wish i would have told my kids how much i love them how proud
of them i was i wish i'd have spent more time with them anyway you know i wish i'd have told my
parents more things and it was where they really hurt it was where they had remorse and pain
facing death and felt that they had lived wrong um the other thing was the second thing was that
the things that felt most important and meaningful to them they put off because of the things that
they felt like they had to do and that was the next biggest source of regret was that their life
didn't align with their own values as much as they wish it had and um so that was very impactful and
i never saw any of them say that they wished they had spent more time with their work and their
productivity i didn't see any of them say the highlight of their life was the things that
they bought um or their accomplishments actually the their highlight of their life was always moments
of uh love and intimacy in ways they had been able to do something meaningful for people and
things like that and so it was very striking how different their reflections on what mattered
were from how everyone continued to spend their whole life and what the market optimized for
and what the state optimized for and what education optimized for it was almost perfectly
optimized for life's full of regret so that was one thing uh i i did not want to make the exact
same mistakes that it was easy to see so many people had as the most fervent thing they could
offer to a young person was please don't make the same mistake i'm like okay i get it i get it um
um also being engaged in activism of other kinds i got to see a factory farm very young
and you know i grew up eating meat without thinking about where it came from while also
having dogs and cats and guinea pigs and loving animals and when i saw the condition of the animals
in the factory farm and that it's you know it was a animal Auschwitz it was a you know mind blowing
unnecessary continuous suffering um i you know i i stopped eating meat that day i started studying
everything that i could about factory farming and animal rights work and i was nine and that put me
into my first pretty like deep suicidal phase because like if someone was doing that to my
dog right if my dog was in that kind of tortured position like i would do anything to stop it
and this was billions of animals that were as sentient as my dog and i didn't know how to stop
it but i couldn't know that that was happening and just ignore it and focus on other things and feel
okay i was like i can stop thinking about them but they can't get out of being there they have no
way to get themselves out maybe since i'm not in there i can get them out it could have been just
as easy that i was born into that situation this consciousness or born as an into a child
soldier in Darfur situation i was born into this situation that is a blessing that i can take no
credit for but there's an obligation that comes with it and the obligation is maybe i can do something
and i realized that i couldn't kill myself because
i that didn't get any of the animals out that didn't you know save them
but i couldn't imagine like okay how do i live and just be normal to people in conversations
and talk about normal shit and be focused on whatever my own personal self-centered stuff is or
knowing that an infinity of torture is happening and be okay with it like i would have to dissociate
completely and that makes me a sociopath in a way and i i so i felt like there was no way
that i could just have a successful life that didn't require being a sociopath but i couldn't kill
myself and so the only answer was i have to infect reforms and so that got me engaged in
activism and then that showed me the overfishing of the oceans and that showed me the destruction of
the coral reefs and that showed me the deforestation and the destruction of you know all the things
and so it just kept expanding and the benefit of that is when you really see
the suffering in the world deeply enough and you take it in deeply enough
that it can never not be with you it's an antidote to the narcissism that is otherwise
ubiquitously conditioned in everybody to just be focused on me my desires my goals my problems
what do i need what how am i advancing myself my progress it's just such a horrible prison of a way
to be and yet in my house that people spend 90 of their time indoors separate from the natural
