available but the first product qualia our goal was especially seeing how much demand for productivity
the world has and how much distraction and kind of damage to people's focus and attention there is
and how much the world has turned to uh you know red bull and energy drinks and off-label
uh you know Adderall as a smart drug and you know so many things like that we wanted to see if we
could meet the needs that people are trying to meet with that in terms of increased creative
productive flow capabilities without the negative side effects and even with lasting positive
benefits where we're rather than overriding someone's regulatory system we're working on
supporting the robustness of the regulatory system so that instead of creating dependence we
actually create lasting positive effects after someone would stop using this that was our goal
and we've been you know we're continuing research and development but we are very happy with what
we've been able to affect in people so far yes well i'm very interested and i will definitely be
seeing what's next because i just obviously this show i started this show to talk about human potential
and i believe that there's many arenas where human potential can be accessed and activated
within each other and i do i do think that there is this this definitely the space for this blending
of technology um in our biological you know creating an interface between that i also think
that there's also space for you know straight up meditation and spiritual facts and psychedelics
i've i've done quite a bit of that as well but um i just want to thank you so much so at this point
in the show i just want to leave you the opportunity to share with people how they can
find your website shows social media anything you'd like to leave my listeners with at this time
yeah just a last thought on one other dichotomy i'd love for people to see if they can ask us
the idea that nature and technology are somehow opposed they have been uh because we have developed
technology without really understanding how nature works without understanding self-organization
and complexity well which has led to externalities but that's not innate to technology nature
evolved us and evolved our capacity to evolve things which you know our tools or extensions of
the evolutionary process of the future is going to be both a very nature integrated and very high
tech world where our technology is an expression of the natural world with the self-organization
and design complexity of the natural world and so whether we are meditating or whether we're using
no tropics i don't see those as fundamentally different kinds of things i see those as methodologies
processes technologies of understanding how to navigate the human experience better utilizing
all that's available to us so um just a just a closing thought people can see more of what we're
