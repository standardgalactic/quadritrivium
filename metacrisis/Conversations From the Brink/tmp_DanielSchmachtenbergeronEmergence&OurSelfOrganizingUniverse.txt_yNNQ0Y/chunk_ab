synergy of people's experience and working with technologies and processes, like meditation,
like breathwork, like transpersonal psychology, like psychedelics, like whatever, right? Working
with technologies and processes that are deeply experiential, deeply embodied, and also being
able to go into those as best pre-framed as possible because of what we've learned from
previous people's experience and interpret them as best as possible within our cognitive model.
So in what I would call a full human experience, someone's thinking and their
intuiting would actually align. And they would continue to work on developing and advancing
both of them as necessary parts of a full human experience. Right on. I'm like,
I'm definitely in your choir on that. I love that. So let's, you talk about this idea, you use the word
emergence and you've used word synergy and is looking through your website. So that often right
now we are having emergence through emergency. And I just love that idea because I've always kind of
referred to it as the band-aid approach that we see something that pops up and then we find the
easiest solution, the path of least resistance to deal with that one little thing without
looking at the systemic issues underneath. So I was hoping that you could talk about this idea
of emergence through emergency and how individuals can help shift us out of that, I guess, mode of
dealing with things. Yeah. So this was a term first coined, as far as I'm aware, by Buckminster Fuller.
And really talked about it as a sociologic, but even just a deeper universal process where
sometimes emergency, I mean, this is the same as necessity as the mother of invention and so
many concepts like this, but where an emergency motivates a foundational level shift that wouldn't
have been motivated previously or wasn't being motivated previously. And so of course we can
have a situation where a problem arises and we just deal with it reactively post facto in a band-aid
way. And we'd see that all over the place and it might be necessary, but it's inadequate for what
we really care about. There are other times where an emergency is big enough that rather than just
put a band-aid on it and then move back to life as it was, it actually requires some core restructuring
at a personal level of our life or at a collective level of how we organize as a species or
technologically or we have so many scenarios where like as we were getting into World War
I, which was represented this a level of war and existential threat we hadn't had, we
end up developing some new technologies that became the basis of how the world became
interconnected transportation and communication technologies as we were getting into World War
II. We mined more copper in the first year the US joined World War II than we had in the whole
previous history of humanity which then ended up leading to the electrification of the world and
then the interconnected communication of the world, cold war giving rise that's becoming
you know an interplanetary species. But you can see that we continued with the warring direction.
So there's a deeper set of shifts ahead for us, but probably so many people who are listening
and part of your community have experienced that whether it was a cancer diagnosis or whether it
was a midlife crisis or a family member dying that there was some personal
kinds of emergency that shook up the whole way of being that they had had that forced
like a reevaluation of who they are, why they are, how they are that then led to a fundamentally
new path that was more aligned with their purpose. And so that happens right and when we look at all
of the major issues facing the world today environmentally, socially, on so many levels
we have emergency, right? We have collective emergency that is potentially existential
and bandage solutions aren't big enough. Bandage solutions will not fix ocean acidification or
biodiversity loss or so many of those level catastrophic and existential issues that the
only thing that will fix them are foundational shifts at a species wide level and how we orient
in universe. And one of the key things is to get that emergence through emergency is kind of like
it's kind of like the safety that if we have not consciously proactively evolved in necessary
ways into the ways that we have been behaving have led to problems, then hopefully those problems
are you know a wake up call a smack to then change. But we don't have to be bound to that
being the primary way we evolve forever as soon as we stop identifying primarily as nouns
and we start identifying as verbs, we start identifying as dynamic becomeings and processes
of evolving and blossoming then as when we identify that there's this evolutionary process
that creates more ordered complexity that has brought about biology and mammals and us
and that with that more orderly complexity comes new emergent properties and capabilities we can
actually kind of identify as not only the result of evolutionary process but in a meaningful way
that that the evolutionary process brought us about as a species with abstraction that can
then contemplate evolution. So the evolutionary process woke up to itself in us where we can now
think about the future understand how evolution as a set of processes is increasing elegant order
of complexity and we can participate with evolution we can not just kind of be a part of the whole
unconsciously governed by genetic programs but we can become agents for the whole itself and
you know what Barbara Marks Hubbard calls conscious evolution,
consciously participate with it and once we identify as evolutionaries we don't need pushed
by emergency or catastrophe or pain to evolve because we are not sitting here as like complacent
things we are dynamically being drawn by what Terry Deschardins called the lure of becoming right
by the continuous process of creating a more beautiful world not because things aren't good
enough now not because we're dissatisfied but because it's the nature of universe to be evolving
and becoming it's our nature to do that and as soon as we start really shifting into that space
of active becoming we de necessitate emergency and pain as evolutionary drivers.
Yes you and I have very different tools in our toolbags but I think that both of us that
I mean that is ultimately when I work with people I I want to help them get excited about
life so they're not doing things because somebody says they should or their doctor says or there's
because of exactly what you're saying and as I was listening to that talk that was up on
Facebook that's what I could feel that sense of passion that sense of wanting to move towards
something and realizing that we are these dynamic these ever-changing dynamic beings and what happens
when we decide to do that consciously versus you know just letting our environment or whatever
the media just shift us so as I'm listening to you and I love it I'm getting excited and I can feel
your passion are there a few things that need to shift within us culturally or in our society like
are there a few linchpins that we could pull that would give people a greater access or an
understanding of our potential I yes and they are at micro and macro levels macro levels
so when we said earlier that there are these false dichotomies one classic false dichotomy is
kind of we can see represented right now in political process
um in the difference between what has been thought of as the primary philosophic elements of the
democratic or republican platform which is also kind of mirrored in the communist and capitalist
platforms which can be oversimplified as the the primary kind of truth of the republican platform
is this agency oriented perspective hey I pulled myself up by my bootstraps even though I came
through from a difficult situation we want other people who are responsible self-directing agents
pull themselves up by their bootstraps we don't want social services that make people lazy independent
and etc and we want to maximize for for agency right and that the collective is the result
of all of the individual human behavior so if we you know and this is in what capitalism would say
similarly if we maximize individual freedom and individual incentive we'll have the best
collective possible because a collective is made up by individuals so that's that side of the story
then the other side of the story which in various ways both the democratic and I'm not saying that
any current candidates represent these well but the democratic platform and in a bigger way the
communist platform is held is hey but wait the individuals are actually being conditioned by
the environments that they are born into and raised in and that we see very clear statistical
correlations between if someone is born in poverty grows up in situations of low education what they
are likely to achieve experience their statistical likelihood for for crime for etc and even though
there are a few cases where someone pulled themselves up by their bootstraps their statistical
outliers so since the individuals are conditioned by their environment let's make better environments
collective environments that support all individuals to do better and so then the question
is well do we want better environments that condition individuals better or do we want
better individuals that help create better collectives and environments and the answer is
obviously yes both and that these are mutually symbiotic and the again the idea that there's
something dichotomous here just means we haven't understood the scenario well enough can we
see if we offer a model for increased agency of the individual like the libertarian model right
like the capitalist model but that doesn't factor for how that individual's agency ends up affecting
others or the whole well enough then we end up leading to a situation of what we you know so
much what we see in the world right pathologic destructive competition hoarding of resources
requiring more resources being extracted from the earth for less actual abundance
you know continuing enmity etc and the tragedy of the commons similarly though if we try to
optimize for the collective in a way that squishes the agency of the individual then we
end up getting dissent and either the breakdown of those systems like has happened with communist
attempts or the enforcement of those systems authoritarian Lee which neither of those are
good so the question is how do we optimize for people's own a genetic desire to evolve and
express and self-actualize and their communal desire to be part of larger holes and contribute
to and take care of them and the truth is if let's say we look at a human body the liver
isn't trying to get ahead at the expense of the kidneys and vice versa in fact they all
need each other because it's a it's a very closely interconnected system and so they all
work very symbiotically when we realize that our planet is this tiny little fragile organic spaceship
in this vast cosmic so far to us uninhabitable space and we are all on that spaceship together
and and there's really no room for infighting right there's really no room for there's no
place called away that we can put our trash there's nobody called others that we can advantage
ourselves at the expense of when we get how profoundly interconnected we are our own best
self-actualization and the best support of the whole will actually be identical if we factor all
the cause and effect loops so we need to really get that at the level of our own consciousness
in our own worldview and at the level of our macroeconomic systems and our infrastructure
so imagine if we had a macroeconomic system where it wasn't that I could confer a lot of
material advantage by cutting down trees and killing whales because as soon as I kill that whale
it's a million dollars worth of whale meat on my on my fishing boat we're leaving it alive it's
worth nothing because the balance sheet of the commons isn't counted right that economic model
leads to massive biodiversity loss ocean acidification all the problems that we see
imagine if we had an economic system where the incentive of every individual was perfectly aligned
with the well-being of every other individual and of the commons and so people could take
incentive could move forward but the collective is being advanced and move forward and everyone's
individual access to all of the collective commonwealth is also growing so that's an example of
the macro shifts that we need to make and at a micro level making sure that our own worldview
is we notice where we start to fall into thinking that we can advantage ourselves at the expense
of someone else or advantage other people by sacrificing ourselves and get get over the
false dichotomy and look at how we can become more omniconsiderate more omnipositive through
better strategy well we only have a few minutes left and so I think feel that this segues nicely
into your the newest thing you're working on which is neuro hacker and I find this very fascinating
if somebody who does a lot of work in my body stuff tell my listeners a little bit about
what neuro hacker is and and why you felt it to be necessary at this time
so when we're looking at how to bring about better global civilization and not through imposition
but a self evolving self governing emergent global civilization then we look at what are
all of the things that end up influencing human experience and human behavior and what are all
the things that that lead to poor human experience unnecessary kinds of suffering and that lead to
poor human behavior unnecessary suffering induced in others via our behavior and what leads to the
opposite of those and what can we do to maximally influence movement in the right direction and
again this is not control this is recognizing we're being we're being conditioned by our
environment all the time anyways how can we be more thoughtful about that to do a better job with it
and when we look at all the categories of things that influence human experience
and human behavior we see that there's there's ways that the physical environment and world
around us does right the infrastructure itself and the built world does and so the whole field
of environmental psychology there's a lot and how do we rebuild the physical world to both be
not only better for the planet but to affect and condition the humans within it better and by
condition i mean if you have a world where to get energy you the energy came through coal and you
really have no options other than that available to you and to not have access to energy ends up
leading to uh just you know no no capability to do the things you want to in the system then you
have to end up rationalizing participating with something that you know is causing inexorable
suffering somewhere else so infrastructure itself conditions a certain aspect of empathy out of
everyone right the way that we currently do it if we had a renewable uh infrastructure it could
condition totally different things in people so infrastructure is an area that affects human
experience and behavior our social systems economics governance law language all do so there
are things we work with there our worldview does our definition of success or definition of self
other meaning right which we've been talking about but our biology also does and when we look at
things like anxiety or depression or brain fog or meaninglessness there are contributors to those
in all of these categories but specifically at the level of individuals there's obviously
psychological uh trauma ideas beliefs that we can deal with through psychotherapy through personal
development methodologies that are important that address what we kind of think of as the
software side but there is also hardware predispositions when we when we look at any particular
kind of neuropsychiatric issue we can see a number of neurochemical neuroendocrine gut brain access
neuro structural correlates and actually identify some of those correlates as causal to some of those
structures and so some of that can be affected through mind-brain interface right things that
you've looked at where shifting mental patterns shifts physical patterns but it goes both ways
shifting physical patterns and everyone who started sleeping better and exercising more and
eating better has had an experience of shifting physiology in ways that affect their mood how
much kindness is available to them everyone who's felt really sick or had hormones at a balance has
felt the opposite and so we've created neurohacker collective to work on understanding how to balance
and optimize the human physiology the neurology and the associated physiology to support more
optimized human experience and human capability so this is everything from increasing cognitive
capability right memory focus intelligence complex thinking to increasing empathy to increasing
the kind of neurologic pathways that meditative non-symbolic experience is mediated across
and so we have one technology that if you go to the website neurohacker.com you'll see is currently
available we have many many more in process our goal is to actually have all that is meaningful in
the space of neuro technology vetted curated synthesized and then personalized so that the
very best tools for working on whatever it is that one is wanting to work on are available to them
and that there's there is specific guidance capable so that's what we're working towards
with that project that is so fascinating when I was looking over the website and would you
describe it as a nutraceutical um so the products that you have that have been specially formulated
to do like you said the cognitive enhancements those just that looks incredibly fascinating to me
and I'm very excited to try so the the product that you see on the website now is called qualia
and it is a it is a nutraceutical it is a notropic which means cognitive enhancing supplement
we are not limited to nutraceuticals we're working on technology in the transcranial
stimulation space and EEG neurofeedback and basically all technology areas that we believe
to be fundamentally up regulating of human capacity without any kind of meaningful side
effects that's our criteria but we started in nutraceuticals and started in cognitive enhancement
for a number of reasons it's an area that can produce a tremendous amount of positive shift for
lots of people and that is more familiar right taking a pill is is an easier step for many people
than getting into devices for transcranial stimulation that are more foreign so if as you
continue to to stay tuned you'll see more and more different kinds of technologies becoming
