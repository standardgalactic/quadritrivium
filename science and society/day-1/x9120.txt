invariance Co variance regularization

and it's got particular loss functions

for this cence Matrix um there been kind

of similar methods proposed by uh and

his team called MCR squared and then

another method by uh some colleagues

from NYU called

mmcr from

Neuroscience so that's one set of

methods and I really like those methods

and I I think and they work really well

I expect to see more of them in the

future but there is another set of

method that to some extent has been

slightly more successful over the last

couple years and those are based on

distillation so again you have two

encoders it's still a joint eding

productive architecture you have two

encoders

they kind of share the same weights but

not really so the encoder on the right

uh gets a version of the weights of the

encoder on the left that are obtained

through a um exponential moving

average okay a moving average so

basically you force the encoder on the

right to uh change its weight more

slowly than the one on the left and for

some reason that prevents collapse

there's some theoretical work on this um

in fact uh this one that jum just

finished writing um but it's a little

bit mysterious why this works and

frankly I'm a little uncomfortable with

this method but we have

[Music]

to um except the fact that it actually

works um if you if you're

careful um you know real engineers build

things without necessarily knowing why

they work that's good

engineers and then the usual joke in

France that everybody here should should

learn is that students that come out of

a good poly technique when they build

something it doesn't work but they can

tell you

why sorry about that

um I didn't study here you can tell
