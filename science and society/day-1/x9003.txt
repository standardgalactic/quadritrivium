left the barn you can't get it back um

and you know I I do think that there

will come a day when we want to be very

careful and and we are very careful

about everything we release um that you

you obviously wouldn't want to release

something that that was dangerous I

think the the the issue though is this

idea of

um some correlation of size of the model

or the number of flops that went into it

versus whether it's dangerous or not

there are lots of ways you could build a

relatively small deep learning model

that could you know be really good for

you know like a old style Gan for

generating poisons or something you know

like there's lots of ways you could it's

not really a correlation with size and I

think there's a little bit potentially a

little bit of

a um an attempt to sort of you know hype

the the AI to make it seem like oh it's

so powerful it might be might be

dangerous

so um I don't think we're there I think

there you know we're not at that level

of capability and I think the other

thing that's really important about open

is that you know every time we've had a

revolution in software where open you

know like open generally wins first of

all but there was an idea that oh open

source software will be less secure

because people can go in and find the

vulnerabilities and the reality and

we've seen this play out over and over

again proprietary software is what's

actually not safe because you know it it

it you can't have the eyes in there to

see what's happening and I think if

we're honest with ourselves we're so

early in this game that the idea that

we' be able to even build these sort of

existentially dangerous systems it we're

not really there but we are in the phase

where Academia where the community can

see what's happening to to be a part of

it to help develop the safeguards to

help develop those Technologies so I I
