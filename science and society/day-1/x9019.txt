for at each instant you have

now stack of of tokens audio tokens

which can then be decoded by the decoder

of the um of the

uh I'm afraid I have to stop it's

impossible to to use this computer here

I'm going to use my computer everything

is is messed up

speech

speech speech forch

spe

is

get

say fore

foreign

fore

spee speee

[Applause]

okay all right so that's that that looks

better um now

we have three 300 tokens for 3 seconds

of speech uh and it can be decoded by

the decoder of of of Mimi uh and it

turns out that

this it's it's

gone it's a night

speee speech

that's up

usually it's just the audio which is a

problem

today it's also with the

video let's let's

go okay hopefully you are still with me

um all right so I will skip some details

it's a CA of encoder which means that it

can run uh on the Fly which is very

important for the applications that we

look at okay now we have this

representation which is the what we want

and we want to fit that to the So-Cal

Transformer which is this big Auto

regressive new network which is used in

llms so and each at each time instance

you have a pile hierarchy of to acoustic

tokens which encode the the audio and

your Transformer produce the next pile

or should do but the problem is how to

handle this

this stack of representations at each

instant every 80 milliseconds so either
