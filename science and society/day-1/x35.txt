talking about AI lots and lots of times

and I even like AI in regulation and I

ask how many people are computer

scientists well half are computer

science how many people are lawyers the

other half how many people are

economists

nobody all right that's just that's just

dead wrong and so um these three ways of

thinking let's not even call them Fields

but computer science is kind of

algorithmic thinking statistics is

inferential thinking very different kind

of thinking and econ is incentive based

thinking and interestingly these fields

have come together in a pairwise way

over the last 20 or 30 years statistics

meets computer science that's exactly

what machine learning

is okay in the best version of machine

learning all right um statistics meets

machine uh computer science sets machine

learning machine learning doesn't have

much economics in it as I've been

stressing statistics meets econ

economics that's econometrics but that's

mostly about analyzing time series and

helping mro economists okay not much

algorithmic mechanism kind of stuff in

econometrics economics meet computer

science that's a field too it's called

algorithmic Game Theory it helps design

new kinds of combinatorial auctions and

on so and so forth it has no statistics

in it it doesn't learn you don't get

learning auctions all right and the

point about it is that green place is

the place to be so if you're at a real

company design in real systems that

really use data and make decisions for

large numbers of people you will be in

the green area you'll be in the middle

you'll be using I all these ideas in a

blend and the students in the room learn

all three of those fields and then

Endeavor to work in the middle in the

green area thank

you Mike thanks very much for a really

thought-provoking uh Key address uh just

to say we'll get a chance to listen to
