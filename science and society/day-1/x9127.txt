hello one two one2 can you hear me hello

oh perfect thank you very much our

fireside chat then will be uh slightly

reduced I have a challenge for our uh

very uh expert scientists on stage today

if they'll accept well keep our answers

short because ultimately we have less

time than we'd H but I wonder if we

might start looking at the concept of

social intelligence um because of course

it's something that uh we're hearing a

lot about as if I start with you um a

question about you know social

intelligence what fundamentally entails

uh understanding emotions perceiving

intentions uh and interaction on a human

level what if any are the limits that

you currently today in artificial social

intelligence great um so uh topic very

dear to my heart uh I feel like um you

know uh we're at an inflection point

indeed uh many panels actually emphasize

that and I think that's probably

something I see a common team across

many of the talks people all talk about

you know AI assistance uh multiple

agents uh and uh I mean I think we're

all predicting that they will be

everywhere moving forward uh and uh I

think U uh the point I want to sort of

emphasize is that uh very little uh

questions or uh investigation is going

into how these agents will be

interacting with the humans uh uh and

even you know more broadly how they're

going to interact among each other uh

mainly because this sort of I emphasized

this today in my talk as well uh these

AI agents U you know uh will be acting

on behalf or or giving recommendations

to humans and those humans are embedded

in Myriad you know social economic

interaction so they basically directly

or indirectly will have to you know face

uh decisions uh that you know will

impact each other uh and I think this is

uh I feel very you know despite all the

excitement about Ai and Society probably

not very conceptualized even in terms of

how we should be thinking let's stay
