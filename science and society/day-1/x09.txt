from the beginning and who continue to

support us these collaborations between

the public sector and Industry will be

vital in addressing the challenges ahead

I'm confident that these discussions and

exchanges we engage in over the course

of this conference will be extremely

fruitful and I look forward to the

opportunity to have some highly engaging

conversations with you today tomorrow

and into the

future I'm sure that the next few days

will go down in history mercu thank

you and I leave the floor to an special

Eno of the president of the Republic for

the a summit

[Applause]

good morning

everyone uh first of all it's absolutely

wonderful to see such a packed

Amphitheater and all of you here uh this

is this is really great um I'd like to

thank uh first of all Laura and tyry for

organizing this and and of course the

whole team um as we started planning for

the AI action Summit uh about a year ago

uh we came up with with um this idea

which now is reality which is that we

need to start the conversation with

science um and I'm particularly happy to

see that it has come to be reality

because of course the latest

developments of AI which uh to everyone

means large language models and um uh uh

chatbots and and things like that but of

course it's broader these developments

we need to remind everyone that they

started in science and they started with

scientific research and new developments

um it's also much broader than that the

reason why we need to start with science

um because of course um large language

models Transformers um all the things

that we're uh that you're working on now

um they are one of the steps of the

development of AI there will be others

some of you are already working uh on

them and it's really important that you

continue to do that uh and that we don't

just think that AI will be forever
