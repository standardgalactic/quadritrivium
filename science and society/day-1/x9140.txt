that positive things could also happen

it might be possible that machines maybe

maybe decision processes taken by

machines could be more transparent

sometimes than human decision- making

processes and if a decision is against

you maybe in the end it's not a big

consolation if it has been taken by a

human so if you can analyze fairness

buyers more thoroughly for machines

maybe in some cases it's even positive

so we we obsess about these things at

the same time we we might uh Overlook

other things that maybe are specific to

machine so so one one thing that I'm

concerned with and I think it also

connects a little bit to to Mike's talk

is this issue of of what content is

generated by machines and what is

generated by humans So So currently

still most of the internet is actually

human written text and most of the music

is still written by humans but in the

future that's it's going to be a big

mess uh maybe most of the text is

machine text most of the music is

Machine music and somehow as a human I

feel I feel a little cheated if if this

is the case and I don't know it so I I

would like to know what was written by a

human by some someone who put effort and

artistic effort into creating something

you'd like to know that up

front you'll know it after a while if

you're not if you're reading something

and it says Marcel PO on it and after

and what was really done by generative

AI after a few pages you'll say no come

on let's stay with that idea though you

know what written that's regulation no

Stan was asking for regulation I I think

this you're speaking about words I

completely agree this idea that

regulation is good or regulation is bad

doesn't make sense we are in an

environment which is constantly

regulated each incentives are the result

of regulations are not opposed to

regulations so the question is really

how to do it and not whether we should
