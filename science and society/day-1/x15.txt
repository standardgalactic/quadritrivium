event triggered a wave of technological

development that we're now seeing okay

mostly that triggered programming

languages operating system it did a lot

for computer science and it kind of

failed mostly otherwise in terms of its

goals what happened in the meantime is

this field called machine learning arose

mostly not in AI mostly not with AI

people mostly operations research

statisticians control theorists signal

processor and so on and gradient-based

algorithms emerged and eventually it

became all focused on scalability and

started to work Dave rumelhart there was

my adviser uh he was one of the

developers at of back propagation he

reinvented it but then he showed it

really worked and his name gets often

missed in a lot of these discussions he

should have gotten the Nobel Prize

frankly uh cuz is the one who made it

really happen and he died young of pix

disease it was it very

sad um uh the other person I have up

there is Leo bryman who did random

forests and random forests were highly

scalable architecture you know different

from neural Nets but had their

advantages and disadvantages gradient

based uh they powered Amazon's Logistics

chains models which made Amazon into a

company that you know went everywhere

and they powered many other companies

around 1990 through

2000 okay so ml deployments were just

these big large bags of data and and and

and gradients and Architectural stuff

there was no talk of AI there was no

agent there was no you know intelligent

it was just doing stuff it was

engineering and it really had a huge

impact on the world huge productivity a

lot of companies were based on machine

learning starting around 2000 every

Company by 2010 was using machine

learning in one way or another no one

was calling it

AI Okay so so then came

llms oh my God it's the same architect
