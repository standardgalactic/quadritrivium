the things about the world that we do

not observe and that uh you know makes

our prediction basically um inexact and

ultimately what we want is a system that

can plan hierarchically so something

that may have several levels of of

abstraction in such a way that um at the

low level we plan low level actions like

basically muscle control but at a high

level we can plan abstract macro action

where the world model predicts at longer

time steps but in a representation space

that is more abstract and therefore

contains fewer detail so if I want if

I'm sitting at my office at NYU and I

decide to go to Paris um I can decompose

that task into two subtasks go to the

airport and catch a

plane okay now I have a sub goal going

to the

airport um I'm in New York city so going

to the airport consists in going down on

the street and handing a taxi how do I

go down in the street well I need to uh

get to the elevator push the button go

down go out the building how do I go to

the elevator well I need to stand up for

my chair pick up my bag open the door

walk to the elevator avoid all the

obstacles and then at some point I get

to a level where I don't need to plan I

can just take the actions um but we do

those type of this type of hierarchical

planning absolutely all the time and I

tell you we have no idea how to do this

with learning

machines almost every robot does

hierarchical planning but the the

representations at every level of the

hierarchy are hand

handcrafted what we need is to train an

architecture perhaps of the type that

I'm describing here so that it can learn

repres abstract representations not just

of the state of the world but also

prediction World models that predict

what's going to happen but also abstract

actions at various levels of abstraction

so we can do this hierarchical planning

animals do this
