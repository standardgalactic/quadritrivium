refrigerator that thing isn't the most

energy efficient um you know ever it's

like you need to be really doing the

things that Quantum Computing is good at

on it and then it can be very efficient

for for what you want to do um so I hope

that answers your question yeah we have

another question there yeah I have a

question related to the example you gave

uh this morning about

compliance um and how to translate uh

compliance regulation into rules that

can be uh automated uh and I feel like

in the legal U uh domain there is an

organizational obstacle in legal firms

to uh use Ai and automate tasks that are

like very easy to uh to automate MH and

I was wondering if what you gave as an

example instruct lab is it like uh uh

only like to solve technological

obstacles to uh this kind of use case or

it can also like uh solve the

organizational uh obstacle to

yeah make AI like more present yeah yeah

yeah that's a great question so it's not

it's not directly supported in in

instruct lab but remember um but I was I

was laying it out sort of as trck laab

is kind of the easy light version you

can do you can do things pretty easily

but then we have the other package

that's sort of our library uh framework

we absolutely can do that there and

we've done it so like you can take all

your corporate documents put it into the

shoot turn the crank and it will convert

them into training data which will train

your model so that your model will

follow your corporate policies and be

knowledgeable about your corporate

policies you could also Imagine doing

the same kinds of tricks to to translate

it into rules that a rules engine could

run um you know there's there's not just

corporate policies there's also

government regulatory policies they're

different in every jurisdiction um

they're they can be very complicated to

comply with uh our customers you know

they they rely on us to do that for them
