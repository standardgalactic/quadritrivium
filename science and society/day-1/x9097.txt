was a debate at some point even whe

whether they found uh di methyl sulfide

that's debated that might not be true

it's something that on Earth is

generated by Plankton but uh it's quite

exciting and and people in this field I

think some of them are optimistic that

maybe in the next five or 10 years we

might actually find uh signs of of Life

somewhere in the universe probably life

very different from our life but still

it would be an amazing

finding so let me go back to this and

maybe spend the remaining minutes uh on

uh some thoughts about causal

representations and then at the end a

few thoughts about U language models and

Foundation

models so uh how do we learn causal

representations and what are causal

representations so we've over the years

we've studied various forms of of

encouraging this kind of learning some

of them built on this uh independent

caal mechanisms principle or on other

things something related which we call

Spar mechanism shift um I'm not going to

go into any of these in details just a

few recent examples so here this is a

system that I think we had last year at

icpr um which uh so here you

you you describe a scene that you want

to generate in words and you ask gp4 to

generate a scene graph and then you

generate a compositional 3D scene by by

scull distillation sampling and uh and

you can you can get these compositions

of different 3D objects here or this is

another system from last year or two

years ago um where uh so the idea you

can either try to build causality direct

into the training or you can take

state-of-the-art training algorithms and

try to make them a little bit more

causal and you can try to make them a

little bit more causal by giving more

control to the user and generating and

here for here the control for instance

could be in a segmentation of a scene so

you give the segmentation and you tell
