technology and have an open discussion I

think having the open source models and

we do release open source models to like

the five models um is the first step of

opening the work to the larger Community

to have a deep discussion about

AI everyone thank you very much for the

amazing

discussions uh my question is about data

contamination uh due to the widespread

adoption of AI both llms and image

generation and in many of Fields uh AI

generated content is becoming extremely

frequent both online but also in

professional

practice um and it is known that uh AI

generated content can minimize the

performance of AI when trained on gener

AI generating

content um how can we deal with these

threats uh avoiding contamination of the

data uh ensure the traceability of the

data and make sure that future AI can be

trained on good content

thanks um I please please don't quote me

on the exact statistics but Gartner uh

did a estimate of this effect this like

the world's being overtaken by

generative AI content and they estimated

that it would be I think it was 95% by

the year 2030 and 99% of Internet

content would be AI generated so it is

kind of interesting that we're we're

just going to be swimming in the in the

backwash of of the AI process and in

fact it reminds me of um there's

something called Low background steel

where when they did the nuclear tests of

you know the tests of the first atomic

bomb you know back in the last century

every all the world steel production was

lightly contaminated not dangerous

radiation but enough the that if you had

to build an instrument for detecting

radiation you couldn't use that steel so

what they would do is they' dig up old

warships that had been sunk deep in the

ocean that had been contaminated and

they build your sensitive you know

scientific instrument for radiation
