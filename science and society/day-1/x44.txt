know AI system you know uh work you know

to the last level of details all we can

say is that there are certain principles

being followed such as using large

models and large data which uh was

missing from this older version of

slides self super prise learning has

been you know invasive you know

pervasively used and uh it is building

task agnostic representations that's

very important AI assistance nowadays is

not build toward a single task but a

whole collection of different

capabilities and so on so forth in the

theory site we actually don't have a

clear idea about what is happening they

may learn you know a manifold which

relies on geometric theories they may

learn a distribution of the data and the

phenomenon which of course shows in

probity theories they may do compression

uh using information theoretic

operations we don't actually know for

sure right but uh without knowing this

can we make progress what the goal is

the the the problem uh the answer is yes

people actually set goals for Building

Systems and were able to make tremendous

progress even before we know all the

details and that's very unique in I

unlike what we see in physics and other

science talking about the goal setting

the goal itself is actually a very

interesting problem and know in Ai and

which actually helps people hopefully to

demystify a little bit what is LM doing

and what it cannot do we all have goals

in our life and you can translate them

into a executable goes for system and

here you can even write down into tis in

the form or in the level of uh

difficulties and here is my pyramid of

capabilities starting from uh read and

write and then do some reasoning do some

planning and uh acting in the real world

and so forth right you can Define tasks

to now make all these capability is

measurable and that's how engineer came

down to the problem rather than from the

first principle and from Theory and that
