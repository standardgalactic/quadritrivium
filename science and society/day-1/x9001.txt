mark my point which is that I'm really

Blown Away by the fact that text became

basically big

vectors I really love the way you you

put it like Tex become numbers in fact

not everything could become numbers and

then everything can be subject to a more

rigorous mathematical analysis using

even simple tools talking about the gwat

for example in the past it's about the

snip versus a discrete phenotype but now

you can basically put everything as the

input to call it a associal analysis to

not just a Geno maybe a whole Gene a

whole protein structure maybe even a

cell lesion and so forth as a you know

maybe uh uh effectors you know or causal

elements into what you see on the

phenotype I think yeah as you said you

if we View

AI models no more than just a encoder to

turn our discrete signals or complex

signals into some kind of a actionable

embedding that alone is already a quite

you know amazing uh contribution to the

science I find the an know I find the

analogy to just like it's just numbers

both interesting and a bit dangerous in

the sense that I think it is super

useful to think about a unifying

framework where the same techniques and

tools can be applied to different

modalities and

applications but language is more than

numbers in the sense that they carry

meaning

values um societal

concerns and then the application of

these Technologies to different domains

needs to think about the different risks

concerns and domain expertise that

different domains bring so I like that

we are kind of unifying it a framework

and Technology level but I also think

that numbers do not represent the

complexity of the society the soci

technical issues and the values that are

encoded in those

numbers yeah I was actually going to um

take it maybe a little further I I I do
