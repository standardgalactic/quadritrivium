still low hanging fruits we have data we

use models that that work and we we see

massive Improvement it's very clear that

there is more to be done in terms of

Designing new architecture finding the

right objective functions the right way

to train the models etc etc

uh and so I encourage you know whoever

in this room uh is looking for a topic

of research for the coming years uh to

think about this types of

applications um I'll stop here uh I

presented the work of talented teams at

B Optimus and and alen and I'm happy to

answer any question if you have thank

you thanks a lot thank

you again we have time for two questions

hi uh thanks for the presentation maybe

this is a naive question um but I'm

thinking about we talk about computer

vision the segmentation models like the

state of the art like some um those

model are turn on cars oranges and stuff

are you really able to level those model

as can you call them Foundation model

for your histopathology can you just

quickly go from those models and just

train them on your data and get a result

or you think that's not possible from

your

experience so everything is possible I

think the performance is not very good

when you do that and we and others are

already developing specific segmentation

models which are just pre-trained on

this data especially using an you know

annotations by by human experts I mean a

mix of self-supervised and annotated

images because the kind of things you

want to segment you know interesting

things to segment are not completely

obvious you know the obvious one is you

may segment the cells you may want to

segment the nuclei but you may want to

segment areas as well so we observe that

uh it's really worth you know restarting

I mean borrowing the IDS the principles

but really starting for foundation

models pre-train on these images and

also F to on specific annotated data
