defined uh but what by what we're seeing

now it's also um important that we start

with science um for a number of the

areas where science can help us think

through this

revolution science can um help um

understand the impact on work for

example which is one of the most

pressing questions that people have have

when they think about Ai and what it

will mean for

them science can help find Solutions and

cures uh in medicine in health and

that's one of the broadest hopes that

people have uh from AI um science can

help find solutions for um the climate

change um and and there's um Solutions

on the optimization side optimizing

consumption finding new material uh for

uh stocking renewable energy for example

but also the development of AI today is

not on the sustainable path and so we

need all of you and more to help us find

solutions to have more uh agile um more

efficient um less energy guzzling um

development of AI maybe more distributed

certainly more open source we certainly

need Solutions uh on the climate front

science can also U help us understand

the societal impacts of AI I'm

particularly happy that the title of

those two days is AI science and Society

uh because this is such a a broad

Revolution with uh impacts on societies

uh in plural as a whole that we need to

think through what these Transformations

mean what do they mean for Education

what do they mean for democracy uh what

do they mean for information uh U

production and and quality and verified

information what do they mean I said for

work for health for climate and I could

go on and on so this is um why it it's

particularly important that you're all

here and that we start the AI action

Summit or the AI action week uh as it

has become uh by these science days let

me want let me now tell you a few words

about the summit itself so well the

summit or or the week the week is
