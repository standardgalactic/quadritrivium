this morning you know the model on a

hill well it's on a hill so you can kind

of really uh make it interact with it in

a very safe way uh it's not distributed

the minute it becomes distributed then

again you gave a very good example um

how do we make sure that um we are

sharing enough data for for those agents

to be helpful to be able to do you know

what you want to do if you're asking

them to plan your next vacation and you

tell them you know I have a couple kids

and we're going to go with friends and

Etc you do want them to know a little

bit about you but at the same time you

probably don't want them to go ahead and

reset your password and and do a lot of

of those things and so I really think

we're entering um a new age from that

perspective where where we really have

to be incredibly responsible upfront and

really think ahead of all of the kind of

defense mechanisms we're going to need

to put in place to make sure that those

agents are behaving in a way that you

know we

control yeah just say a few words about

agents I mean it's one of those things

where everything is now an agent you

just call you just say agentic a lot

sometimes in the field and and they call

that so I think we don't have a great

definition of what it is but if if we

mean like doing actions I think we all

agree that's that's a good thing maybe

we want to have affordances around how

to check if we want to think about

formulating a plan I think that's a good

part of a definition um and having the

metaphor of it it's like a little buddy

who goes out and and does stuff for you

I think it's helpful for people to think

about it but I I guess where I worry a

little bit is twofold one is this idea

that well we have these things sometimes

that we can't control them let's let

them all run loose in our our systems

and interact with each other it it feels

like well that that seems like the wrong

solution to that problem so I I do think
