forth okay so this sounds interesting uh

this sounds like it's relevant to the

problems we're talking about so now

we're going to have to talk about our

nodes as being things like principles

and agents that's the language used here

the principal wants to do something the

agent knows how to do it and they need

to interact and there's asymmet of

information the agent knows something

the principal doesn't know so we have

this uncertainty to manage in our

Network all right and there are

algorithms there's a beautiful book by

lafon and marmore uh written quite a

long time ago in France about many kinds

of mechanisms that'll kind of you know

how do you design that menu now what's

missing in economics almost always is in

microeconomics there's no data there's

no learning you design the system you

put it out there and you're done so all

of Statistics is not being used there is

statistics meets economics that's called

econometrics that's more about measuring

time series and and and more for

macroeconomics but in microeconomics

precious

little okay so we modeled this uh we

wrote down a bunch of equations um a

bunch of Statistics equations and a

bunch of Economics equations uh data is

now a good and a service it's not just

bits on a on a wire it it has a economic

value and entities could be both a

principal and an agent the platforms are

both principles and agents so we have a

hierarchy now of principles and agents

not just this classical principal agent

Paradigm we built a model and I'm not

going to get into the details here and

now this turns out to be what's called a

generalized stackle BG game just a

little game theory came in h the

platforms make a decision about what

services how you know how much

differential privacy user decides which

platform platform decides the price to

charge to the data buyer buyer decides

where to PR you know blah blah blah blah
