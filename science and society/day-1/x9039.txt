especially since IBM is a very

performing uh superc conductive kind of

computer inous yep yep that that's

that's a that's a great question it's a

common question that people have um and

I and I I would in like all like I I

don't the quantum people don't give me

any like they don't pay me so like I I

think they really do have the best

quantum system like real Quantum system

like no no joke it's a real thing and

they have a really amazing aggressive

road map that said I I'm it's not the

way Quantum Computing works it's not

necessarily like it's just more amazing

Computing and in fact the the kind of

regime that we're in for doing AI is

very different than the regime that

Quantum Computing Works in well so you

can basically you can get relatively

small dimensional data in and get

relatively um small volume of data

through a Quantum algorithm um but a

Quantum circuit can compute you know

infinite you know like vast

possibilities you know exponential

spaces kind of stuff while you're in

there and then the the characteristics

of how we do AI training they're just

very mismatched to that so we are

looking at interesting ways that we can

marry the two I I think they will it'll

be less about power savings and more

about solving problems you couldn't

solve otherwise uh because the main

thing that that that Quantum Computing

does is it it's the only example in in

the known universe where you can

actually compute with a different

complexity than an algorithm would

normally have in traditional Computing

so a very exciting technology it's going

to do lots of interesting things in the

world and then Ai and and Quantum it's

going to be an interesting dance but it

it won't be won't translate into some

sort of obvious um Power savings for AI

at least not that I can see in the near

future and also quantum computers like

ours come in a giant helium dilution
