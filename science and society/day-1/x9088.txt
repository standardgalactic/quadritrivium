twins so you can already think uh what

what is he going to screw up in this

case at Institute poly Technic De Paris

so this is the image that it gives I

think it's at first side it's it's kind

of compelling uh there's a few things

that are

funny uh first of all I think it is

trying to have twins here so it was

thinking maybe I'm the digital twin so

it put a twin uh but then it got a

little bit overboard and even the triple

on the

screen of course these are different

people but let's not worry about this uh

but if we if we if we zoom in on some of

these

areas then the whole thing starts

looking a bit like a painting of

heronimus Bosch so you have strange

faces growing out of the backs of people

and and all sorts of things like this so

people with multiple multiple heads and

of course the the

system has no idea that this is really a

composition of multiple people it just

generates an audience overall and it's

has gotten very good at it but it

doesn't understand that it generates

individual

people and uh if we think about what

what kind of representations of visual

scenes would we like to have then uh I

think we would like to have something

more like this so this is an

illustration that was done by my wife

and she's a a children's book

illustrator and if you look at

children's books each picture somehow

tells the story so this picture if you

look at it it it tells you it tells you

what might happen to this glass if this

side goes up it tells you what what

might happen to this thing if the if the

chicken uh eats these these grapes or

whatever it is um it suggests what might

happen to the cat so the Picture Tells a

Story it tells you about uh what

interventions are possibly image and

what might happen if you take these
