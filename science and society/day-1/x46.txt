teach you how to swim to actually

navigate you the traffic they may have

an issue because uh many of the skills

that we human being have you know are

not uh uh uh best expressed in the form

of language just like pouring a water

you don't write it but you watch a video

you know how to do it right and uh there

are also Al a lot of uh um contents that

stay outside of the the textual

literature and that already sets the

limitation about what you can achieve in

large language models and I believe you

know uh you know people knew it but

people uh just don't you know uh

directly connect to the fact that lar

language model is not there to give you

a you of understanding the way we human

defined it right in fact the space where

large language model

you know are doing their work is a very

small one in our universe of

possibilities and reasoning and here you

can see what's remaining right for

example we have uh you know the space of

real time and space and the multi-

agency with other people and the law of

natures all these don't be surprised

that they may not be handled by large

language models but we don't call large

language model stupid because they

cannot do it because they were not even

made to do that right so in that sense I

want to continue with two examples about

what I see to be the future of this AI

movement in terms of exploring more

space of possibilities the first one is

uh a agent and the word model which can

help us simulate you know a cognitive

and behavioral activities you know in

the real world what is a word model well

the word

model there are many definitions uh one

famously defined from Professor yung in

his seminal article and here is my

definition it's a simulator of uh both

the physical word the emotional word

embod experience social experience and

all that you know uh that's basically

making up the world you are living in
