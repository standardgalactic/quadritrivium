year and as of now all the disciplines

we covered which includes eight

departments in different areas of AI

collectively ranked top 10 in the world

and we publish of course thousands of

papers and uh we graduated 100 students

many of them stay in the UAE and we even

roll out many startups and train many

government and the private sector

leaders but this University is unique in

that it is not about just education and

the basic research we almost also like a

industry where large Foundation models

modern AI infrastructures were deployed

it and utilized and explored and pushed

further and here uh just a list of uh

some of these projects you can see we

produced actually the largest and best

Arabic natural language models and also

we've been developing models for biology

for the world model and many other

things I think that's probably an

interesting new approach to Modern

University where you want to bridge the

gap between University and the private

sector to make them more agile and also

more resourceful in terms of how you

know uh large skill you know modern

science in AI can be carried out

otherwise University indeed will will be

stay out of the game and become less and

less relevant with the fast advancement

of AI and through that effort we were

able to really push uee to the frontier

of global AI competition one of the

rankings published in Stanford last year

actually put you in now among top five

of the AI power countries and I believe

our University made some positive impact

in that ranking in the next couple of

years we are going to continue to grow

but not only in the space of AI as mik

mentioned you know AI is u in fact many

years ago we don't even call ourself AI

we call ourself statistical machine

learning and other things which means

that you know it is a very very profound

and this interesing field which can

enable a lot of other topics and as a

university we cannot just solely write
