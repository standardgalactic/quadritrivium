think there's a lot of uh you know

discussions uh around regulation much

Europe is clearly way ahead in these

discussions uh but at the same time if

you think about human behavior forget AI

we're clear on where that is regulated

right so you know in applications of

Health Care in applications of you know

uh you can't give medical advice I can't

U you know unless I'm properly certified

but uh these days you know U actually

that's one of the most appealing things

of AI models if you put your mom in

front of it that's the first thing they

ask you know what what medicine should I

use should I use this should I use that

so I think that is the way uh I'm

thinking of around regulation you know

there start where human uh systems are

regulated there's a lot of work that

went into it so instead of trying to

figure out what are the risky places

where AI uh you know uh trying to Define

risk through the AI system really go

through the humans and this human AI

complimentarity because these systems

will be used by humans so if you start

by you know uh where the US is already

regulated uh that would be an easy way

to go uh but beyond that I agree with

Mike the other aspect of it is proper

incentives and proper uh maybe coming

from the government uh incentivizing uh

socially beneficial directions where

this will uh you know enable humans to

flourish can we actually incentivize

more research more uh you know

development in those directions I think

that's the probably one of the most

productive the way I have a very simple

message about regulation I think it's

you know perfectly fine to regulate um

the deployment of AI systems certainly

if you have a driving assistance system

in your car you want it to be tested by

some government agency before it puts

it's put on the market if it's used for

uh you know medical diag diagnosis

analyzing x-rays or other medical images

you certainly want you know some sort of
