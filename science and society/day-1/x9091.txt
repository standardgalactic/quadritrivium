violence this violate this independence

by looking through this hole because

this hole is set up exactly such that

the direction of G gaze takes a specific

Direction relative to the structure of

the world

so we can uh we can try to formalize

this and we've done this in variable

ways and U the most the best

formalization that we found now I think

is is quite interesting and and I think

there's a lot of uh interesting

directions how to follow up on this um

and this is a building on the notion of

exchangeability so the bottom line of

this will be that if you have

exchangeable but non IID data then you

can in certain cases identify the course

of structure from data even if you have

just two

variables so normally we want IID data

for machine learning we try to make sure

we get IID data we try to collect data

that's exactly the same between training

and testing but it turns out that this

is a message here that for causal inance

non IID data if it's the right kind of

non data is actually more

useful so this is uh not going to go

into all details this is the classical

defin theorem so uh you have uh an

exchangeable sequence of random

variables exchangeable means the

permutation doesn't or the the

probability is invariant under

permutation of these random variables

and

U what it tells us so IID data are or

IID processes are exchangeable but not

the other way around but this theorem of

the defat tells us that um even if

they're not IID we can make them

conditionally IID conditioned on a

suitable random variable which we call

Theta here um so it's a

mixture of conditionally IID processes

according to these what one could call

prior probabilities and this

distribution of that variable that's

what what or this variable is what's
