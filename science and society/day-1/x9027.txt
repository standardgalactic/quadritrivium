good is that we're forecasting three to

four trillion dollar in economic

benefits across all kinds of different

Industries this is an incredibly

versatile technology we're we're

projecting it's going to be really

really valuable 80% productivity gains

across classes of knowledge workers and

creative tasks that might be a somewhat

exuberant uh estimate but that's that's

kind of where people are targeting 80%

of Enterprises will have Incorporated um

gen into their their business processes

over the next three years and 70% of

software vendors will integrate

generative AI into their Enterprise

applications so these are the Gartner

sort of threeyear projections and and

you know even though these are really

aggressive numbers you know three years

is forever an ai ai is like in dog years

you know like one dog year or seven

human years it's like that but so this

is a really really long time so that's

the good um the bad I mean we've talked

about it at various points here like so

this is the sort of the early part of

the curve um before it became less clear

where how big many models were but there

there's a trend towards using more and

more compute over time and that compute

ends up using power and and that power

has all kinds of external effects and in

fact if you if you didn't know this

we're we've been on a track for a long

time where by some estimates by the year

2040 our year-over-year compute usage

growth is sufficiently high that we

should exceed that we could exceed the

power budget of the planet Earth so

there isn't enough you know solar

radiation coming from the Sun that we

can collect you can't commission nuclear

power plants fast enough you can't dig

up stuff out of the Earth and burn it

fast enough to keep up with our

Computing habit so either something

about the energy curve is going to have

to bend or we're going to have to deal

with this this you know incredible
