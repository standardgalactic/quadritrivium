groups many companies are working on

that

specifically now there are other things

that you know biology is more than

molecules and as soon as we we talk of

you know a disease or experimental Labs

often we don't look at molecules we look

at things that move uh the basic unit

basic component of Life probably a cell

you know human body is made of I forgot

maybe 10 to the 13 cells many many cells

all of your cells have your chromosomes

your DNA you know the reminder of high

school biology uh and interestingly all

of your cells have the same DNA right

because the DNA more or less but the DNA

you get are the dnas you get at Birth

and then all your cells have the same

DNA so if you understand the DNA you

understand something but you don't

understand why you have some cells which

become blood cells others that become

neurons other that become skin cells

okay so there are other ways to

characterize the cells not only through

DNA but for example through the activity

of the genes within each cell so you

know DNA gets activity to produce

proteins we can measure tens of

thousands of genes proteins how they

they they are activated and there's been

lots of so there is now Technologies to

Sy systematically measure that across

many cells here we're talking of tens of

millions of cells that have been

analyzed this way each cell

characterized by tens of thousands of

parameters which are the activity of the

genes and we've seen lots of an

increasing number of foundation models

for cells that try to learn what is a

cell and you know uh starting from the

human body uh there is something called

a human cell Atlas initiative which is

an

international uh Consortium to generate

data and from that we we start seeing

models that learn just from the data the

identity of a cell so we see clearly you

know once you learn these embeddings you
