like smart glasses and things of that

type in the future and in in those smart

U devices we'll be able to

um access AI assistants that will be

with us at all times and we'll be

interacting with them either through

voice or through U uh electron um

electrogram CMG um the glasses will

eventually have displays although

currently they don't

and

um and we need those systems to have

human level intelligence because that's

what we're the most familiar um um

interacting with we're familiar with

interacting with other humans uh we are

familiar with the level of intelligence

that we expect in a in a human and uh it

would be more you know easier to inter

interact with systems that have kind of

similar forms of

intelligence um so you know those

ubiquitous assistants um are going to

mediate all of our interactions with the

digital world and U that that's why

that's why we we need them to be easy to

use for a while population that is not

necessarily familiar with um using

technology okay but the problem is

machine learning sucks compared to what

we observe in humans and animals uh we

don't really have the techniques that

would um allow us to build machines that

have the the same type of

uh learning abilities and Common Sense

and understanding of the physical world

um so animals and humans have background

knowledge that allows them to um learn

new tasks extremely quickly understand

how the world Works um being able to

reason and plan and that's based on what

we call common sense it's not a very

well- defined concept um and our

behavior and behaviors of animals are

driven by objectives

essentially

um

so I'm going to AR arue that the type of

AI systems that we uh we have at the

moment um or or that everybody is you
