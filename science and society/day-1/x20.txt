basian decision so the basian duck would

go

left all right because there's more food

to be have there if the basy and duck

says where's where do I maximize my

utility well it's to go left

all right now if you do experiments with

this Ducks don't do that ducks are not

basian Ducks probability match they see

oh I see there's two-third as much food

on the left as oneir on the right

therefore uh what I'm going to do is

two-thirds of the time I'm going go to

the left and one3 of the time I'll go to

the right that's not optimal from a

basian point of view I can prove

that right but they do

it moreover humans aren't basian either

they probability match and there's been

tons of articles in you know col science

about how humans are terrible to

decision makers because they're not

basian okay but the framing is wrong

here okay what if there are many

ducks okay what if there's a collective

of ducks right now what that's a

different problem it's more of an

economics problem what should an

individual duck do all right well I

could have a top- down regulatory

government framework that says that

two-thirds of ducks should go there and

oneir should go there and everybody will

be happy and that's probably what's

going to happen in

Europe

or I could just have a little algorithm

where each duck randomly decides with

probability 2/3 to go there and one3 to

go there distributed decentralized

algorithm chaos will ensue right no it's

a Nash equilibrium it'll be highest

maximum social welfare so it's actually

optimal to probability match in a

situation like this so the collective

also determines what do you mean by

uncertainty what do you mean by

decision-making so if we don't talk

about collectives we're missing out all

together on of this stuff if you put a
