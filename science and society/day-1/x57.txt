structures are obtained using two

popular experimental techniques either

x-ray crystallography or nuclear

magnetic resonance andmr

spectroscopy you can use one or the

other depending of the size of the

protein whether it can be crystallized

or whether you want to study it in its

native solution

environment and that's actually quite

difficult x-ray crystallography requires

a synchr term which is really big once

you have an image you mathematically

solve the inverse problem to get to the

protein structure and after de Decades

of experimental work about

170,000 structures had been detriment

and collected in the protein Data Bank

pdb which is an incredible resource and

I'll get back to

that in 1994 the cas competition started

critical assessment of techniques for

protein structure

prediction predictions have to be

accurate to the width of an atom that

less than one anstrom to be of use to

experimentalists this competition

provides a blind assessment it leverages

protein known experimentally but not

published

yet and for its 13th edition in 2018

Alpha fold our AI based solution placed

first it was the very first time that

machine learning was introduced and a

main component of the

prediction Alpha 2 won the 14th Edition

of that competition in 2020 and achieved

Atomic accuracy which led the organizers

to declare the problem

solved the scientific Community

immediately recognized the importance of

this discovery nature called it called

pro protein structure production the

method of the year in

2021 and debus deep Minds confounder

John jumper one of my scientific

colleagues were awarded the Nobel Prize

in 2024 in chemistry for Alpha

fold so how does alpha fold work the

protein Data Bank which I mentioned
