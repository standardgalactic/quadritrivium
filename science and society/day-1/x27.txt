the data they improve their models and I

get a better service that's kind of nice

right but it's often the case that those

companies don't make enough money off of

the service the little fee they charge

uh a lot of downward pressure on that so

what they then do is take the data and

they sell that to third party buyers

this happens all the time there nothing

wrong or weird about this happens all

the time now why do the data buyers buy

the data they're not trying to compete

with building better models compete with

the platforms what they want is to use

the data to do like market research you

know what I want to have a new Thai

restaurant in the 13th Hour new small

let's look at kind of what kind of data

what are people talking about what kind

of what's missing for restaurants you

know so I can buy data and learn about

that and happens all the time all right

now you got to say though but what do

the users don't don't the users have a

little concern about this they're losing

privacy their data is getting shipped

off to some Anonymous third party buyer

they've lost something maybe they don't

want to play this game why should they

do it okay that's a perfectly good

question you can't just assume they're

going to do it so we got to think about

the

incentives all right and so here's the

way to think about this valy Razer is

that the platforms have got to give some

kind of guarantee of privacy okay and

what's that mean well we have

differential privacy it's a pretty good

framework so they can do differential

privacy which adds some controlled about

noise to the data and different

platforms could decide how much privacy

they will offer it's part of their

service so I'm going to offer you you

send you work with me I'm going to add a

lot of noise to the data before I send

it to the data buyer so your privacy

with difference of privacy is very very

high I look at that and say great I'm
