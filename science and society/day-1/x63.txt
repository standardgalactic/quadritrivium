doing here in France with the cury

Institute met Gemini

is our family of models fine-tuned for

the medical domain we've explored the

broad capabilities of Gemini our most

powerful L langage model we've inherited

its native reasoning

capabilities and the long context

ability and we've also explored

capabilities in specific domains like

Radiology pathology dematology ofy

genomics here you see an example of a

dialogue with met Gemini in the radal

setting in this

interaction it demonstrate its ability

to analyze a chest

x-ray and conduct a dialogue with a

primary care physician it identifies

mild generative changes along the spine

and can answer questions about the

resoning which led to this finding

demonstrating generally General Medical

knowledge about degenerative dis disease

and distinguishing between correlation

and causation in relation to the patient

history of back pain and it also explain

it's capable of explaining its findings

in Lay person's terms which is really

helpful to facilitate patient

understanding and communication in

clinical

settings in materials

Discovery we built a tool called gnome

which is short for graph networks for

materials exploration which ches deep

learning to determine the structure of

more than 2 million inorganic crystals

of those the tool was enabl to identify

which ones were stable at low

temperatures which is opening the door

to new materials that could power future

Technologies ranging from

superconductors powering supercomputers

and next gen batteries to boost the

efficiency for example of electric

vehicules gnome uses two pipelines to

discover low energy stable materials a

structural pipeline which create

candidates with similar structures to

non crystals and a compositional
