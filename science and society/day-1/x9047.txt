nucleotide Transformer and see if we

plug like here a unit on top is it going

to get us good results the thing is this

is giving you really nucleotide

resolution we did it for 14 tasks at

once so in one go if you take for

example like a 30 kilo Bas pair sequence

in one go you have almost half a million

predictions so you can see very clearly

what's happening and Incredibly this is

working super well and this is the

concept again of self- supervising

providing structure you see that part

here on the right nucleotide Transformer

imagine we remove that imagine we just

do the segmentation with a unet and we

train from scratch that's a performance

on the left here for classification

tasks with the MCC coefficient you see

it's not amazing and even like if I were

putting like a Transformer style um

block before but it's not pre-trained

it's just like random parameter it's not

performing but put the model that's been

trained at the whole genome for multi-

species and you get the magic this is a

huge gap in MCC as you can see with

segment and the model we buil and open

source so that gives you an idea and the

performance really is is quite

remarkable compared to other other

methods so with this method in one go in

less than 10 milliseconds you can

essenti

completely segment completely understand

what's going on in genomics and we're

constantly increasing this window in

terms of like context window we're

nearing now uh the million uh

nucleotides so this is really like some

exciting work that has consequences

without getting too much into details it

actually generalizes through species

here if you look at increasing

Divergence from human on the tree of

life you can see that the colors become

like uh less and less

uh sort of like dark this means that

performance decreases through time but

you still have great generalization for
