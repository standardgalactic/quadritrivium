continued by this uh Audio Only language

model

H there is no audio in the room I'm a

Fred I guess it's a moment I have I have

to tell a joke or

something

fore

spee

foreign speech

I'm sure you very impatient to to listen

to that

to fore

listen to your sister to live is a risk

at all otherwise you're just an inert

chunk of randomly assembled molecules

drifting that was the

prompt maybe I should have an AI giving

the talk instead of me so now you're

going to listen to the same with the

continuation listen to your sister Morty

to live is to risk it all otherwise

you're just an inert chump of randomly

assembled molecules drifting and Tangled

in The Ether you don't think so all

right fine then listen to your sister do

you want to make it in the world are

going to die alone with nothing but

their

kindness okay so now it knows how to

speak but not very good for dialogue so

it's pure continuation here but with the

the the the the voice of the of the uh

prompt which is continued which is

already very promising now if we want to

have the same thing but alternating or

with the dialogue between the user and

the AI you need to have both uh The

Tokens The Blue and the and the green on

the slide okay uh going into the big

Transformer and the first way to do that

is just to interl the two but then we

are back to the walki talki issue so in

order to enable or to to to to prevent

from having speaker terms what we did

instead is to have two explicit

simultaneous uh uh sound uh streams

which are processed by the Transformer

so now it means that the two can talk at

the same time and listen uh and we end

up with this architecture which we call
