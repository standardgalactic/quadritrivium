model we keep the language model

unchanged weights are frozen so really

like we are bringing the DNA insights

the precise understanding state of the

art like we've seen into the language

model and we're like could we now

formulate tasks where I'm actually

asking the question in English and

embedding here a faster file so

basically a DNA file in in the middle of

this of the sentence and giving the

model the ability to understand this and

you know what I'm going to express it in

many ways like 20 different ways to ask

the question 20 different ways to ask

the answer that gives you a variability

of 400 question and answers and so on

and do this on tasks on which we have

data and the incredible thing here is

that it actually works and it works

better than a model trained only on DNA

and this is for me super exciting not

only do you have a model Chat N that you

can speak to but this is also a model

that is actually as a performance better

and done all in a single sort of like

training stack you're asking the

question in English putting in the FASA

file in the middle of this of the of the

question here we have some example of uh

exact tasks including the one I

mentioned about protein melting on which

the performance was quite remarkable and

so you're conversing with the model in

English but the model has has an

extremely accurate understanding of

biology and in that sense it is well

Superior way superior to the models

coming from NLP that understand biology

just because hey they read lots of texts

online about biology here there is

granular understanding potentially at

the single nucleotide level of biology

and for me this is the future

multimodalities like this can unlock a

lot of value by blinging in different

modalities in in ways that without

perhaps wouldn't work and so really like

perhaps my last message and I don't want

to take too much time because we're
