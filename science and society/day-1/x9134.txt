these tools are being introduced for

Radiologists for doctors actually

they're not really helping um you know

they introduce new types of uh mistakes

even uh you know those that didn't exist

pre AI because they don't really

understand the recommendations that uh

these systems are making sort of this

communication you know AI systems can be

great can give you all kinds of uh you

know information but if the

communication between the human and AI

is not properly thought of and designed

they may actually lead to uh different

kinds of issues in the case of

Radiologists you know there are all

these headlines around that you know

this is actually making it worse well uh

it's because they misinterpret uh the

signals the recommendations they don't

get the complete statistical information

through those recommendations and it

basically says okay uh they don't know

if they're telling them what they know

and they immediately succumb to things

like confirmation bias so I I think it's

very important for us to continue to

focus on this sort of transparency

legibility however you want to call it

that aspect of these models and at the

same time you know make sure that people

are well trained to be able to better

work with these tools I mean that's you

you spoke about kind of Mis interpreting

uh things there and how you know that

could lead to issues Mike if I bring you

back in here if we look at a national or

International level what kind of role do

uh governments do companies do we as

individuals have when it comes to making

sure that there's transparency that that

AC was just talking about you want me to

talk about

that I mean I think regulations should

come well after you start to understand

what the technology really can do and I

and and I was talking about equilibria

in my talks

today that you're going to put a lot of

things out there that'll interact with
