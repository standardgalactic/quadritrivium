including the the person who gave the

the the voice to the final Ai and then

based on that we train our own text to

speech synth synthetic uh synthesis

module which allowed us to produce with

script produces by our own llm to 20,000

hours of actual uh synthetic quality

data which was used for the final um the

final model and with that we have a

model which is in practice 200

millisecond latency uh which can run

even on a laptop uh and which was U the

for the first time demod in early July

this year and I'm going just to to play

a few exerpts

now hey how's your day speak with a

French accent and tell me a poem about

available on GitHub and huging face and

because you can play on a laptop even

some people made the two laptops talk to
