DNA is a sequence of characters

therefore the language model

architecture should work also on DNA

maybe on protein this is very naive in

fact in the DNA and amino acids and the

nuclear acids speak a very very

different language not Al the cell

structures and other you know uh

dimensionality where functions and

activities can be found so there is a

lack of uh uh how should I say this uh

uh enthusiasm or uh or uh ding spirit of

exploring new architectures including

new representations new tokenization and

uh and the new agis new loss functions

you know in the architecture I think

this space is owned by a small amount of

uh uh very very core people uh waste the

resource and waste maybe the right data

but the community is not big enough and

that's why as a whole we see you know uh

Academia and maybe uh even you know uh

you know researchers industry by and

large as a simple simply practitioners

and the followers of a given

prescription and try to make instances

of it and that least to my second

question which challenge which is a

cultural one how to change that uh in

Academia uh I I have to say that in the

past several years it's disheartening to

see that uh many of the uh people in

Academia who want to do deep learning

and the large skill machine learning and

AI had to create position and joy

industry or they uh just do something

very different which is not very

relevant to be honest to what we see as

the modern AI they do maybe some fine

tuning they may do some prompting some

uh kind of a follow-up incremental work

rather than being the leaders in this

field and creating new architectures and

new theories and so forth um there's a

challenge you know uh in terms of how we

incentivize how we enable them Empower

them students and the faculty and

researchers alike to jump onto harder

problems and uh be ahead of in in fact

the industry and being the intellectual
