language model will be better but for

many others for example like melting

point uh prediction you're actually

getting better results in genomics with

genomics models than protein language

models that is surprising and that shows

you here the sort of uh cross

fertilization potential and if you go

even more granular if you look at the

exact nucleotide sequence that's

encoding uh a particular uh like a

particular protein well you have

synonymous codons so multiple codons can

encode the same amino acid guess what we

tried just to take that uh DNA model and

change those synonymous codons and

actually this uh gets you worse results

if you put a uniform sort of like

distribution between synonymous codons

this is not going to work if you shuffle

them around this is not going to work so

the message is genomics models capture a

lot of precise detailed information and

we found that to be actually quite

surprising and quite interesting and

that if you want the best results you

better use exactly the coding sequences

that nature uses so there is a lot of

richness and subtilty and I and I hope

you find you find this actually

interesting we tried also variations of

tokenization and the like you know which

pretty much like depends on the task at

hand so it's not super interesting but

if I deep dive more into one particular

task for example example like melting

point like at which point does a protein

lose its its structure what you see here

comparing a protein language model and a

genomics model is the fact that as we

said for this task the genomics language

model is better but if you add context

for example you give GC content you know

we have four letters in DNA at tcg if I

give the GC content uh as a context well

the protein language model is going to

do better than without Ste genomics

model is is better if I give the species

I give that information that gives you a

lot of information including the GC
