to meet you Mrs Shah however regarding

your fundraising efforts bad timing I

must say since universities will

disappear within three years given the

current pace of AI

development this bold and and the tiny

bit provocative statements reflects the

Deep transformation we are

witnessing needless to say that to

navigate those

transformation I believe that the world

needs more than ever The Guiding lights

of Science and education but it shows

how the spectacular progress of AI is

not just about science and technology it

is reshaping the very fabric of our

societies it challenges our relationship

with creativity with knowledge with work

with learning and teaching and even with

social

interaction throughout history Humanity

has questioned these topics of course at

the rise of the printing press during

the Industrial Revolution and at the

dawn of the of the internet but rarely

have we had to confront all these

questions

simultaneously and what's more facing

the existential challenge of climate

change at exactly the same time

compelling us to reinvent our society

entirely from top to

bottom at the called poly Technique we

are no strangers to moments of profound

transformation a school was founded in

1794 in the midst of a revolution when

France had to reinvent its entire so

societal

model and at that moment

France made the choice to build the

foundation of its new regime on

knowledge and science as a way of

collective and individual

emancipation today have we as we

navigate a new Revolution I believe a

cult po technique and universities all

around the world can once again be

essential actors to ensure not only

Innovation but

progress a c po technique has has built
