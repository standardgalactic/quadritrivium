going to work work with

you okay that means that that platform

gets more data than the other platform

that means it can build even a better

service there's a little virtuous circle

there but the data buyer looks at that

platform and says wait a minute you're

adding a lot of noise to the data that's

crappy data I can't do statistics with

that I'm not going to work with you I'm

work with this other guy and so you can

see there's tradeoffs and all you got to

do as a good machine learning econom

person is write down a bunch of

equations that have all those trade-offs

them write down the utilities find the

equilibria and study the equilibria so

that's what we do in a sequence of

papers not only this one and I I decided

not to in this talk get into the details

of the equilibria but let me just say

that behind the scenes there's something

in the of the theory of incentives

Happening Here we have asymmetry of

information somebody knows something

that someone else doesn't know how much

they're willing to pay for something and

so you can't price things if you don't

really know how much they're willing to

pay you kind of have to guess or run an

auction and the theory of incentives

does things like business class economy

class fairs it says I don't know how

much you're willing to pay but I'm going

to give a sequence of

options and each one of them will have a

different kind of service and have a

different price and then you get to

choose and everybody gets the same

menu and if I design the menu well it'll

kind of cover most of the willingness to

pay and I'll get a few people paying a

lot a few people paying less the

airplane will be full and all and this

saved the airlines in the 1980s the

airlines were about to the you know

governments were propping them up uh but

this contract theory came along and

saved the airlines by having these

different kinds of fairs and so on so
