sets thank you yeah another question

there hi thanks for great talk um

question about in biology and also in

Pharma we need mechanisms so why do

things work they work not just

prediction of what we can think can can

happen so how do you think we can get

there so um I think in the question

there are maybe different things one is

we need when you say you need we need

mechanisms I would say probably we need

uh let's say causal effects because uh

when we say well I see a correlation

between survival and a protein

therefore the protein may be a good

Target this is not enough right you

would like not only the protein to be

correlated but if you if you inhibit it

uh you would like survival to increase

so there is some notional mechanism

there plus maybe there is a notion of

you need mechanisms for regulatory

approvals right when you have a drug you

need to explain how it works uh I would

say the causality to me is one of the of

the key questions behind all of this

work it's very hard you know there are

experts I see Berna here about cality

probably you know in that field what's

needed is data right so there are ways

to to generate perturbation screens

where you have data you do perturbations

You observe the output what's hard is

that you cannot do that on humans so

there is a massive translation problem

which is if you understand causality in

a petridish how do you map it to

causality in humans regarding the

mechanism to explain like if you want to

wa a reg you know regulatory approval

because you have a new drug I think that

that one is is Deb because what what

matters at the end is is the performance

you know if if you have a treatment that

just extends Survival by a year then

you're good to go and we always find

some explanation a bit skeptical about

you know all the explanations we find in

biology are I mean most of them are

useful none of them is is very very
