it's not we're it does not make it clear

that it's getting

better AC did you want to add something

there no no I thought you did uh I'm

conscious of of the time and we could

literally sit here there's so much uh to

unpack together I just want to you know

we've had a lot of positive um Talk up

here about AI today I just want to end

on a positive note and then we can get a

couple of questions just get a sentence

for you in a nutshell one thing that

you're particularly optimistic about

going forward uh with AI Stephan if we

start with

you okay

[Music]

uh there are many but I when when you

asked the question I I had something in

my mind so I will trick it in positive

and both side I think there is one issue

that we don't consider most of the time

which is neither positive or negative

but it's education and it's the impact

in of AI in school it's probably one of

the place where things are moving the

fastest because the kids are moving very

quickly are using it very quickly and

the

teachers are quite destabilized about uh

using that so there I think it's a very

important area where we should put our

effort to be

positive uh so that we understand how to

help teacher

to adapt to the situation they are much

more exposed than in universities in

University we think about oursel how to

do it but it's not so complicated High

School below is much more interesting

much more important and that I think is

a domain where I think we should

positively focus our energy okay St so I

hear you saying you know harnessing our

attention on Educational Systems uh

Vernard if I can get your sense of

what's optimistic uh in your in your

view so I think the global problems that

we are facing in particular the problem

of climate change but also the problem
