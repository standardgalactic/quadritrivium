leads you to start Building Solutions in

the form of what we called models and

that's where you'll see actually where L

stands L is actually at the bottom of my

task list they do very well in writing

and reading and maybe also uh uh

speaking but uh uh the question is that

can they go even above or can we assume

that they naturally already achieve

everything above okay and U that

basically is a question valid you know

valid for uh uh measuring and

calibrating every model we building so

that leads to what is language model

what language model you know to a

technician to a engineer it is a system

doing just one thing which is the next

word prediction okay and uh through that

operation of NEX world prediction you

get all the user experiences fascinating

experiences answering your question

solving Mass puzzles and so forth but uh

it is not directly Auto automatic

translates to understanding you know uh

the content and uh also you know uh

maybe uh you interact with the real

world in fact uh uh it may just be very

very intricate string matching based on

a vast memory of remembering all the

world knowledges likewise you can make

the same uh assessment about a large

visual model right people obviously

wonder do they really understand the

word do they really reason or it's just

a word or pixel manipul

but you can think the questions from a

different angle do this this matter why

do you even build this system for do you

build a system in order to understand

the content or do you build a system to

solve problems right and uh that's why

you know we got this quote from the

famous statistician George box he said

you know all models are wrong but some

are useful if you think from a

utilitarian point of view maybe there is

a more practi itic but actionable

approach toward AI systems for example

we may ask what L is not able to do

these days well if you asked llm to
