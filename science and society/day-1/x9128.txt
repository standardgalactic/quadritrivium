with that as I'd like to bring uh Mike

in there because this notion of the

decisions that are made and and how

they're done Mike you you've spoken in

the past about uh the development of AI

the fact that it shouldn't Focus purely

on creating uh autonomous humanlike

entities what do you make of the social

Framing and how ultimately it impacts

how we think of

intelligence well I think if you stand

back 50,000 years from now you ask what

happened in this era it wasn't that we

were entertained and it you know was is

really that we created culture we

created uh works of art we created ways

to communicate with each other we

created things that inspired us that's

what humans do and to me technology if

it doesn't attach to that I'm just not

so interested I don't really want to

wear a pair of glasses it reminds me I

should have an appointment at 9:00 I I

really want to have something that gives

my enriches Human Experience and it's

not just my individual Human Experience

so for me the world is full of not just

stuff that I got a model in my head it's

full of people I interact with and I

don't know what they know and they don't

know what I know there's no way I've

capturing all that in my box so I want

to build economic systems so I maybe

just you know in my career I've you know

I started with Dave rumelhart watch back

propagation watched the aor rate go down

down down down and I said okay Brute

Force AI is definitely going to be a

thing someday I don't want to do that I

want to make sure the systems are

reliable trustworthy I started becoming

a statistician I got enamored of

statistics and Yan probably you know

during his talk not noted that Mike said

the word statistics too much in those

days now last 10 years it's economics I

see economics everywhere I see

information asymmetries I see people not

understanding each other I see need for

if you bring people together things
