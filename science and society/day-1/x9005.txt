I've been a very very adamant um you

know Advocate about open models as a

university uh uh leader uh I feel we

actually have not just a need but also

responsibility to uh create a platform

for opening the model you know some one

of the project we did actually at MB is

to train you know uh llama compatible or

even super Lama type of large language

model you know but then open up not just

the weights but also the code the data

the checkpoints and so forth so why we

do that I think the the main reason is

to really create a community of not just

users but also researchers and the

Builders of those models many people for

various reason don't have the resource

and also the data and the engineer uh

Power Force you know to really get into

the business but but by opening it you

actually demystify many of the processes

of uh creating all those and as you both

said there is also a real opportunity to

study the risk and uh and also the uh

the pitfall you know of uh existing

implantations I don't believe that

prepared software offers that kind of uh

you know uh opportunity you know to to

be safe but if you have more users and

also more players in the field I I think

it's made the whole kind of a program

safer and also make the community even

safer right so it's really about you

know creating the larger community of uh

working on AI the other benefit I'll add

is that bringing more scientists more

diverse communities into the decision

making and the discussion about AI we

are all here in Paris because we believe

it's an inflection point as stated in

the title of the panel but I think

there's an important Fork on the road

where do we rely on a few selected

people under some close organizations

making decisions about the development

deployment and the impact of this

technology on the society or are we

having an open discussion where we can

see the data see the models look into

both the benefits and the cost of the
