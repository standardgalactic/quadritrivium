but I've still very much remained over

low dimensional model explanation based

on few facts and now we have experiments

we have data which offer the possibility

of building much much more uh complex

models including the models of uh

network but again in social science it's

like in physics you are not just

interested in prediction you're

interested in understanding and there

again that's going to be the issue of AI

we have prediction system the

understanding

below is we are quite far I mean so much

uh understanding that that's needed and

it's certainly something that you

brought up um Yan earlier I'm going to

make it an interesting shift here

because a lot of the questions that have

been coming in from our audience today

have been around sustainability with

with AI so I'm shifting slightly uh

given the lack of time uh bernon if I

bring you in here and I'm going to go

straight to the point what kind of

headways or progress has been made when

it comes to uh making energy efficient

algorithms that can ultimately help you

know answer some of these Global

challenges uh which which we're

facing I mean it's it's a big worry

first of all of course what's going on

currently if it's uh if it were the case

that all uh search queries were replaced

by quaries to a large language model uh

of the gp4 type then I mean if you if

you do a backup for the envelope

calculation it might well amount to 10%

or more of the overall energy

consumption of the planet and and

there's a lot of people if I talk

to young people some of them say I don't

read a text anymore if someone gives me

a text I first ask GPT for to summarize

it so we we will find more and more uses

of these things so first of all it is a

issue of course people are working on

getting smaller models personally I find

this just as important as as this

massive scaling and trying to make
