founding president of Muhammad bin Z

University of AI in Abu UAE I'm also a

professor of computer science in carneg

mdo University in Pittsburgh USA and

also uh I'm a co-founder of a new um

startup called Jam bio which builds

Foundation models of biology you can see

I wear multiple hats and this topic of

AI um uh and what we do with Foundation

what's the future to me is a fascinating

but very very complex one because I'm

both the consumer and also the producer

you know all those models and I've seen

issues you know uh all over the place

but maybe I want to you know finish the

instruction one thing many people

thought that uh you know uh we've done

enough AI it's so risky and so powerful

we should slow down and understand more

I'm a strong Advocate

to basically go even faster because I

don't think you the more we do AI the

more I feel that we know very little

about uh the foundation the application

and also the potential and not only can

be discovered by doing more and you

double down and triple down so you

discover more questions and risks and

then you talk about Management's

regulation and uh uh and uh and maybe uh

compliance thank you

thank you very much uh let's Deep dive

into one of our topics uh many current

Foundation models excel in language

processing but struggle to integrate

other modalities like Vision Audio or

biological sequences also they struggle

at uh to perform well on some specific

tasks uh according to you what are the

key obstacles to achieving truly

multimodal foundational models and what

advancement in model architectures

training methodologies or data sets can

we have to uh address this

issue um Dr bar as you've presented my M

ji would you like to

start yes so I'm I'm happy to start and

and as we as we've seen uh this morning

already we have a large language models

that are incredibly capable already
