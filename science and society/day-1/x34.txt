field emerging like civil engineering

like electrical like mechanical every 50

years there's a new field that emerges

it's an engineering field this

engineering field different from all the

previous ones has humans as part of the

engineering thing okay civil engineering

not so much electrical engineer not so

much this field does so it has human

decisions and data and flows on networks

those are the ingredients of the

engineering field and what is the goals

of the engineering

field well to solve science problems

yeah sort of but also just to build good

Transportation Systems to be bring good

health care to solve climate problems

just to make all of our seven billion

people on this planet actually have a

good life that's the goal of this

engineering field and to make education

better and make it more interesting art

uh possible and all those great things

that humans can do if they're augmented

with these kind of systems all right so

I think it it's really interesting

emerging field it builds on ideas from

inference it builds on ideas from

algorithms it builds on ideas from

economic from three centuries all right

but as just flow exactly from them kind

of in the way that like you know

chemical engineering flows from quantum

chemistry uh there's a little bit more

of a gap so we're kind of making it up

more as we go along but I think this

whole development of this wonderful

engineering field is really being held

back by this old AI aspirations uh build

a Super Robot that takes over and or

helps you for all your tasks at home and

all these kind of things all right so

just last slide that was all about kind

of the uh what is this technology and

what's it mean for society and all that

um but you know as academics and I am an

academic and always will be um it really

is critical to recognize this isn't just

computer

science okay I've been in the room
