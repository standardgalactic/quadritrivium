simultaneously this is a good question

we should all face as scientist so I

want to conclude uh by one example which

again come out of France you know Dr

pastia you know who invented the

vaccine can you call them he a canonist

or a humanist I I don't know but what

one thing I know is that by the time he

invented the vaccine we don't have

knowledge about DNA we don't have

knowledge about protein we have very

little knowledge about the cell right

therefore that discovery of a vaccine

getting people you know uh immune to

infectious diseases is a pure empirical

finding and it was adopted and accepted

through very rigorous tests and that and

saving millions of life I think uh we

are at the same moment right now in AI

where great inventions and the great

capabilities are being presented it is

us to decide you know how to mitigate

risk but also how to balance you know

the speed of innovation in that

direction versus uh you know uh being

cautious and being uh uh risk avert to

uh impose strict regulations about what

we're doing so with that I want to go

back to uh my first page where outline

the future of AI in the next few years

uh I think the major mission that uh we

want to push forward including within my

own University is to deploy AI in the

larger space of possibilities for

reasoning and then find solutions to

make that happen and also Implement you

know uh solutions to you know Drive uh

capacities and needs you know in human

society with that I want to conclude my

talk and thank you very much for the

attention Eric thank you very much

indeed for that again another insightful

uh talk for us a really good note to

leave us on what next in terms of

responsible AI uh just want to let you

know that uh Eric will participate in

our round tables that will take place at

just after this section of the program

again your opportunity uh to make this

an interactive event if there are uh
