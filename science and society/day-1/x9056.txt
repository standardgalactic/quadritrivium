models K mentioned Foundation models for

genomics and for proteins think of that

as a massive Foundation models for

proteins that has been trained by

observing in the nature uh the sequences

of billions of proteins and as from this

data has learned a computational model

of what is a protein right well uh and

then it has been fine tuned in a sense

from this computational representation

to say well now that you know what a

protein is it should be easy to predict

its shape it's 3D organization and and

works more L okay so no need here

probably to to spend too much time on

this notion of foundation model it's

really you know an approach that starts

by collecting lots of data learning from

the data using some neural network uh

the something about the data and once

this this knowledge has been

encapsulated in this computational

representation fine-tuning it using it

to solve specific

tasks U llms of course do that uh they

take books or text and transform these

text into numbers and then from these

numbers are able to Sol many tasks so

there's obviously an interesting you

know coming back to my initial uh

problem which is we don't I we we lack

equations in biology what about

replacing equations by a model that

would be a foundation model for biology

and the principle would be if we are

able to collect enough data of biology

and follow similar principles you know

self-supervised training could we get to

this computational representation of

life that then could be used for protein

structure of prediction but as I show

for anything else understanding biology

predicting response to treatment Etc

Etc so that's you know that's a bit the

the vision for for you know this talk

and and of course I'm not the only one

to have this ID many many people Karim

as well mentioned that but it turns out

that of course the field of biological

data analysis has taken the train of
