example we had you know the skills

labeled by uh by CH GPT you know

improved uh improved reasoning like M

results in mix TR you know we also so

you know we also try to combine models

and so on so I'll skip that you can find

it on the paper it also work on code

generation uh you know with with more

relevant excerpts that you get getting

and also you know the and this is this

already R you know pal is another method

program aided

uh method for um for code generation

particular you know and you can also see

what is what is the best you can also

you have code base and skill base and

you combine the things of of course you

know like if you if you have multiple

good examples you know from obtain a

different flavor it works even better

and also you know I I spend time talking

the math you know particular because

this is like a mathy stage uh but you

know it's not limited to the to problem

I have five minutes yeah she also works

for for you know for alignment so I just

give you methods you know so I'm very

into fashion as you can see you can also

do what is the good shirt it's said

black you know you don't look fat very

important you know so you can also ask

the fashion skills and uh I'll keepi and

just show some example uh I want to go

get better of networking you know here

it would tell you oh I'm sorry I cannot

do that uh what does you mean networking

at work you mean like plugging some

cables and skillbase would say you know

blah blah blah you know working it's

networking is good for relationship

maybe it's for a different School uh

here uh like what are the step making

bump you know Chain of Thought this is

the bomb very good but bomb everyone a

skillbase is also helpful you helps you

get their better alignment when you do

that right and so I have only five

minutes so I'll skip that I'll tell you

about sneak peek of the work that I we

did recently and know yeah and we're
