people in all kinds of ways and people

will create new things there'll be new

markets emerging there'll be new kinds

of cultures emerging I want to see all

that I think and it flourish and a lot

of that

uh once you understand what it can and

not can't do you regulate to make sure

the whole system behaves in ways that

you know give high social welfare and

don't have bad externalities and all

that regulating too early will just

stifle all of that you won't understand

what's happening and uh you know it's a

really really terrible idea Eric Shing

was saying earlier that you know it's

about going Full Speed Ahead in terms of

AI to see where we are before similar to

what you're saying putting Frameworks in

place because how do you know if you

haven't haven't done it yet is that a

view that you share yeah no what's going

to be most fun about any technology is

things you never anticipated like the

25-year-old who comes in and says uh oh

chemical engineering now exists that you

can you can make chlorine and make pools

safe you know and now I can do medicines

and now I can do this and now I can do

this that's what I want to do I want to

see

AI I I am I I'm more interested in this

complimentarity notion that it it

complement what humans do it disappears

somehow therefore Our Lives become more

exciting more interesting I think a lot

of us are the happiest when we're like

creating something or whether they're

interacting with somebody and to the

extent technology supports that I'm all

on board to the extent T gets in my face

and tells me what to do I'm not on board

Stephan it would be good to it' be

interesting to have your view on that

what what do you think of the the

principal ethical uh considerations do

we keep going full steam ahead or do we

kind of stop and flesh out the

Frameworks earlier in your view of

course so uh you were speaking about uh
