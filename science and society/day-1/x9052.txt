training what's your personal take on

the availability in terms of quanti and

quality on that sort of data set I I I

think what's exciting is that

uh it used to cost many billions of

dollars to sequence a whole Human Genome

now it costs less than $200 so money is

not the problem anymore and it's

extremely important that we increase the

quantity and quality of the data we have

there I'm thinking in particular I mean

at inad we passionate for example about

development and AI used in the

developing world so for example if you

look at Africa the world would benefit

if we had more genomic data sets from

more populations because this is really

Paving the way to personalized medicines

in a way you understand the patient much

better than before and perhaps you can

recommend this drug rather than that

drug based on the specifics of a given

person so on the data front

unfortunately this is still very

imbalanced and we have to work

collectively to uh build a world where

data is more representative of human

populations and hopefully unlock new uh

sort of like breakthroughs in therapies

I believe it's

possible thank you again Kim thank you

so

much and I'm very happy to learn that

you are open sourc in your models

absolutely great news it's really

important yes yeah thank you thanks

again well uh we'll keep diving into

Foundation models for biology Life

Sciences uh with John Philip ver now

all

right so until the slides come on the

screen U I'm JP I'm a scientist I've

been training for the last 20 years to

to use AI to cure cancer U is hard and

what I want to do today is is try try to

share with you you know some some of the

observations where we are and how Ai and

Foundation models could help uh so I'm

both uh you know leading the R&D at Ain

which is an AI uh unicorn that develops
