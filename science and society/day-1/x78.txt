saves an enormous amount of time think

about my compliance example where I

would present a menu of options and you

click on the right thing if I say 20%

Then that needs a lot of review

and I think it's only by sort of

coupling at least in these high stakes

problems where reliab is is

essential um that uh that we need

statistical ideas to be able to quantify

how certain we are that an AI automated

a task correctly at Stanford we released

a paper not long ago that basically

takes the answers that chat GPT um gives

you when you prompt chat GPT and would

actually parse the answer into a series

of claims we'll filter out claims that

we believe are incorrect we'll keep a

certain of claims and they'll say you

know with probably 80% Emanuel I think

this

biography of Joel is correct and so what

I'm here I have to understand with this

is that whenever our system says 80% and

I look at all biographies and every I

will say that 80% they indeed correct if

the biography of Joel is 20% correct

then you were about to submit it then

you have to be a bit

careful about what your ability to

submit so I think it's extremely

important to augment um AI systems with

these Notions of statistical control

that have improved manufacturing so much

and that I think will improve

engineering enormously in years to

come you talked about um statistics

complementing the AI systems we are

building what I want to say is that

there is also a lot of ideas from

systems all the way to human AI

interaction that plays a part in terms

of putting these II systems into the

world in reliable ways so when we look

into the systems that are built at

Microsoft for example yes at the core of

it we have the foundation models small

models specialized models all stack of

models that become the base layer of

this infrastructure but these systems
