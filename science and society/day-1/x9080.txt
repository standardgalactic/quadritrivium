are just synonyms and you're also paying

people you know for labeling just random

noise and what's worse you know humans

you know always decide something know

sometimes they can really know but you

know there's always something sometimes

it's just like difference of text and

they select one so either if you select

one wrongly because it really doesn't

matter beginning or end doesn't matter

you also send your gradient in

potentially wrong way and so that means

you're making more noisy you know you

know what if you you know be more smart

about which things you're getting uh in

the in the which things which two or

three or 10 uh labels you're giving you

know to your to your laborers at the

very end of alignment of a post training

right and so uh you know of course you

know people that do that already figure

out this is a problem they many many

random tricks you could do for example

you you you change the temperature you

make it like you know you you do

multiple examples you know you maybe do

something models but there was not

really a way how to actually do it

optimally this is what you know the you

know optimal design is is for right and

so this you know and and when I was

thinking about it that you know remind

me me like the something that Remy tgh

me like 15 years ago about linear

bandits in linear Bandits you have uh uh

you you're trying to find like the best

linear function for your for cases you

know this is typically like you know Len

CB that was used in Yahoo to select one

of your eight articles and each of them

are linear and you have like for example

linear is a line and you want have some

other there was just eight articles and

you TR what is the best you know product

with this line right so like the product

is volume and so the best one is just

the one is the most aligned well and so

you can try all of them and see what's

align but at the beginning as you're

this recommender algorithm works you you
