there okay so I I really think this

model of you know build the biggest

thing on the hill that had NOS every is

is is not feasible it's going to ruin us

and second it can't know everything

because what's in my mind right now is

the context of what I'm going to do next

today in life it cannot know that and if

it doesn't know that it can't give me

good advice

and and I think it's this advertising

model where these companies thought they

could know everything because they've

seen our entire browsing history and

they could predict really really well

and therefore let's build AI that just

predicts and it'll tell us what to

do okay all right so I want to do

something different so I want more of an

economics model and I want to do that uh

in the context of markets so to me

markets are a good word um you know in

some environments you know markets are

are viewed as capitalists and I've kind

of gotten questions about wait minut I

don't markets ruin the world what are

you trying to do here I think markets

are good well they've risen throughout

history many cultures many times there

how humans interact they reduce

uncertainty so just like Zola talked

about the market that brings food into

Paris somehow someone says I got some

Tomatoes over there they're not enough

Tomatoes I'm going to take my tomatoes

over there charge them maybe a little

higher price and and uh you know Tom

Tomatoes will be available everybody

does something like that every day and

now I can gu guantee there'll be

Tomatoes most days in most places why is

that good well because if I'm a pizza

owner now I can have a pizzeria because

I can guarantee I can find them Tomatoes

any day of the week all right and then

if I can have a pizza I can have

something else on top of that I can have

something else that things can emerge if

you can build stability uncertainty is
