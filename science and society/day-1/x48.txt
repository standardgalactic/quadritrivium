know from a particular board position

and then using a monal Tre search to

find the optimal one and then execute it

right you can imagine that now my

situation is not the board position but

uh you know real world problems like uh

you know uh a traffic you know in

autonomous driving like a uh you know a

uh in Battleground configurations or

maybe something you never experienced

before like how to colonize a Mars and

so forth and you can use the same idea

of simulative reasoning to solve many

problems and that's actually what think

what world model is about not sure this

video is playing oh it is

playing what this basically is a video

showing you how we might be able to

qualify even the quality of the the word

model by you know measuring or testing

its theability you know because the word

understanding is not very well defined

it is a very subjective opinion or maybe

capability for human but how a word

model understand the word well what if

you can tell the word model to do things

you like steering the car and uh moving

the objects and uh you know uh real time

instructing AIC behavior and then the

word model execute that probably gives

you a hint about how word model can

understand the real word right you can

also put the agent into the word model

because you know uh many word models

these days uh are being equivalent to

generating videos or generating 3D

contents but that's not really all the

possibilities in world the real world

contain people therefore agency and our

agents can be another content inside the

world and then they collectively

generate signals into your artificial

brain and then over there you can have a

thought space you know doing herar

embedding and putting back the responses

making recommendations of actions and so

forth so this is uh a direction we see

to be highly promising and important for

the AI to go beyond large language

models and uh here is a uh you know
