mitigated by

markets all right prediction becomes

easier when you have

markets right um now markets have to be

regulated so this is you the obvious

question oh you like markets that's

great but don't they you know spin out

of control don't you get monopolies and

all well yeah sometimes monopolies are

good actually not so necessarily but you

know things can spin out of control and

they do so you want to regulate them I'm

a total yes we need to regulate them but

you don't regulate the individual

algorithm the individual mechanism you

will create unintended consequences no

doubt about it you regulate the

equilibria of the system and to find the

equilibria you've got to be more like an

economist and study what are the

equilibria and how do they change

so I'm going to give examples of

that okay so I've been involved in a

company for about 10 years now called um

United Masters uh the CEO is a friend of

mine Steve Stout Downer he's a legendary

hip-hop producer in the United States

everyone knows him and this is a

three-way market so you don't usually

study three-way matching Market you

don't really study this in economics

very much but um so what it is is that

there are lots of young people you know

16 to 25 year olds who create music on

their laptops and they're really good at

it and they put it up on the internet

and that that's the music that other

young kids listen to so 90% of the songs

that have been listened to every day and

at least in the US 90% are songs you

never heard of the artists you've never

heard of and they were written in the

last six months so it sounds sounds

great a thriving Market exists no

they're not making any money no money is

being ex everybody takes everything for

free and a few big companies find a way

to make some money off of

subscriptions all right so this is a

different model what it does is we We
