AI

applications uh to help you know cure

diseases I will speak a little bit of

that and also co-founder of bi Optimus

which is focusing specifically on

building Foundation models for biology

in order to fuel companies like Arin who

they a

Solutions okay so before the you know

before talking about the details uh I

think Karen gave a a fantastic

introduction to what can be done with

the latest AI technology to analyze data

um if you know because the session is

about form Theory to practice if I had

to summarize uh for the many of you who

are not very familiar I would say with

you know how you make a drug like you

know I say I want to cure cancer how do

you go from an an ID to a to a drug in

fact it's a long process I think there

are immense opportunities for techniques

like AI to impact that process uh this

is the just almost a commercial slide I

will not go to say this is taken from

ain's pipeline this is how a company

like Ain basically does business I just

wanted to highlight that you know making

a drug means lots of things and there

are many steps where actually AI is

likely to you know to push the the

performance of the process uh going you

know from the left of the side to the

right basically to make a new drug what

you have to do is to to start by better

understanding the biology sometimes it

leads to what's called identifying a

Target literally a drug Target meaning

you have a disease and you find the

weakness of the disease uh so AI can

help because by analyzing data AI can

help understand biology once you

understand the biology and you have a

Target you need to to design a drug so

like a weapon that will Target the the

weakness of the disease and there again

there's lots of AI being used today

generative AI to design molecules to

design proteins that will eventually be

the good drug you will use to Target
