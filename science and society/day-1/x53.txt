ones so that you can do only a few weet

lab experiment you know to validate and

this is getting the biological science

closer to what we do in other places

where such as a you know power plant

design chip design relying heavily you

know on simulation and the Computing

instead of uh trying you know a physical

production you know uh to uh to explore

all possibilities

so I think you know there is a potential

you know for such a AI driven digital

organism to be a new paradigm for inico

biological research just like we do in

other disciplines and science so here

are just two examples I want to share

with the audience about the how AI May

evolve and develop in the next couple of

years and uh I want to close by making

the following remark you know scientists

you know uh uh are supposed to be open

and also uh uh undogmatic but it turns

out that uh in the past uh you know

several decades you know where

scientists ourselves become uh uh rather

uh dogmatic about the approach we take

we become uh less skeptical about the

science itself right and this is

actually you know probably a side

product unexpected from cism because uh

reasoning and the first principle makes

you feel so powerful and so satisfying

whereas human ists you know uh who you

know rely on empirical evidences you

know uh you know uh and having

skepticisms you know for almost

everything makes people less confident

makes people feel unsafe but I think

with the advancement of AI which Builds

on large model the progress and outcomes

the engineering products are maybe for

the first time in history dramatically

outpace in our ability to

understand every fact and every theory

behind the finding so should we stop and

wait for the theory to catch up or

should we carry forward the

experimentation you know uh to uh to

advance the science and at the same time

you know uh doing the understanding
