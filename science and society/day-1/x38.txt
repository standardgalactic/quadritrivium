of his uh graduate students uh many many

years ago it's always intimidating for

him to speak after him because he always

uh dive you know so you know deeply into

uh the Technic content which makes a

good foundation for me to roll out my

presentation I will be stepping a few uh

stories higher to give you maybe a more

broader view about uh uh what's Ai and

what is going on in the whole field uh

in fact uh another speech from president

laa was uh also very interesting she

mentioned about uh uh a comment where

University may disappear in three years

uh with new AI uh I took it a slightly

uh different way I think uh indeed there

needs to be a lot of change in modern

universities in light of modern Ai and

uh encourage you to actually rethink how

to reprogram University and that's

exactly what I did in the past few years

so I want to take the uh this chance to

also say a few words about a new project

I have been doing which is to create a

brand new University of artificial

intelligence in a young country called

UAE right so this is uh what I've been

working with you know in the past four

years I went to Abu Dhabi in UAE to be

the first president of uh this

university called Muhammad Bing zadi

University of AI it is established

exactly five years ago and uh it is

meant to be a graduate school you know

uh for AI research and Innovation and

over the past uh four or five years uh

we actually made uh tremendous progress

know in thinking how to create a

sensible modern program in Ai and beyond

that and also how to uh build on the

success or maybe you know lessons you

know to do even better and here is a

quick word about where we are right now

right now this University you know has

been uh really uh doing a very very

actively you know in expanding we

actually went through a very very

aggressive you know path of expansion in

the past uh four years you can see this

grow rate which we kept about 50% every
