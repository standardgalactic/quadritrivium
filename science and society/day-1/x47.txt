and imagine that you have a model that

can produce contents in all these then

you literally have a word you know uh at

your finger tip in the digital form and

how to make that is a technical design

which I'm going to BR away but they

involves of course you know uh ability

to process sensory data you know uh L

memory and uh ability to uh uh

persistent memory and also uh carry out

objective driven architectures and so

forth right but uh the biggest value of

having a word model is to allow you

really do reasoning among a bigger space

of

possibilities there are you know uh a

different way of uh defining reasoning

we thought that all reason is about

finding the shortest path toward our

goal or finding the optimal solution to

a task but everyone of us

probably from time to time do something

called a thought experiment which is

means hypothetical thinking you just

simulate outcomes of a potential

Solutions and you pick the best one

right and that's actually you know a

very intuitive way of thinking about

reasoning Which is less you know elegant

and mathematically rigorous but it

works and here is what a word model can

enable you it defines you you know uh a

Oracle which simulates the next state of

the word given the previous state and

action and this little equation if uh

you just expand the scope of possibility

and content can help you do a lot of

things for example you can set up your

goal and then you can just do forward

simulation by drawing samples you know

from this uh distribution or this uh uh

generative model and then you have a

multiple Pathways toward the goal one of

them probably is hitting your goal

others are getting closer or further and

then you can choose the one that is best

for your fit or in your

budget in fact arpa goal is a

implementation of this idea it is

simulating multiple you know moves you
