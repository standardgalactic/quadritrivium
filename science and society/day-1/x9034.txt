the open Community um why does software

work so well software works well because

we can take uh code from anybody in the

world and you can contribute it's it's

really it's it's really interesting you

don't even have to know the people who

you contribute in their project and

that's because you have this whole

infastructure of of this tool chain that

goes around it where you take source

code you can commit things to get

there's a way to manage source code uh

so you can have poll requests and

discussions about the feature and if

it's the right thing you can commit and

then you have this compiler tool chain

for compiled languages or um and you

have an operating system there's Notions

of libraries there's packaging there's

build orchestration systems that manage

the whole thing so you don't have to

figure it out yourself every time in

contrast to llms where it's like lots of

you know you put on the the the hoods

and you kind of go and do your magical

incantations and stir the pot uh it

doesn't have that same feel of being

something like you commit software um so

what we're doing is building the um

exactly the sort of analogy of to to

what a make file is what the software

tool chain is but for llms and uh we're

already open sourcing parts of this and

then we're GNA sort of bring the whole

thing out together and the idea is that

every one of these pieces has an analogy

we can have we can have people from

communities all around all of our

customers all of uh you know people uh

you know that we don't know you know

again you don't have to know the people

to have contributions they don't have to

be our clients we don't have to be doing

business with them but we can start to

get to the point where we can build

software uh you know build llms like

you're building software and one of the

key pieces of this is in how we generate

uh synthetic data um and then we also

have a version of this it's sort of
