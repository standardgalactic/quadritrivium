mix because as

technology okay so so with work on that

you know many people are working on that

this is the result of a recent it's not

by us it's a it's a benchmark that was

published at new ribs last December

which exactly you know Compares fation

models for this task can you predict

gene expression from an image um I show

it in part because it's important in

part because I'm very proud of the bopus

team who developed this model which is

open source and today is the leading

model in this uh in this Benchmark uh

but you know besides the who wins or who

is a Etc what I find really interesting

uh is that on the right if you have good

eyes you may see that you know the model

that is not so good it's called resonet

50 so it's a bit old I agree but this is

one model that you know three years ago

was state-ofthe-art and with a

particularity that it has been you know

not pre-trained at all on hisop

pathology and then from there to the

left these are pathology Foundation

balls and you see that the difference uh

is very visible so this you know this is

what I meant earlier in terms of we see

the scaling laws pre-training a model

with more data more quality data really

changes the performance I'm not sure

it's an alpha fall moment on that field

but we go you know from 30% to 40% in

just two years this is still massive

Improvement when you think of the impact

of these of these

techniques um of course to do that we

need data data is coming if you're

interested I'm happy to you know to to

mention how we Access Data how we

generate data but in that domain data

generation is super important it can be

done in the labs it has to be done with

hospitals

Etc and in terms of Technologies you

know something that is very very almost

embarrassing is that there are so many

things to do now that I would say lot

lot of the things we do and others do is
