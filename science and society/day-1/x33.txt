functions payout functions are like

licensing terms how long you can do it

for what kind of uh strata you know all

all the details now the business it's

like business class economy class I can

look at that and I say well that one is

good for me because I happen to know

that my protein's actually pretty good

and very likely to pass so I'm going to

take a little risk and go for those

licensing terms and some other company

says I don't know much about my protein

I'll take the different one so we have

now mechanisms for Designing that menu

and I'm going to show a theorem

uh because this is a science conference

and I was told we could actually show a

theorem uh we have a theorem which says

that a contract is incentive aligned

okay meaning that you're you're the the

right thing to do is to send in the good

drugs not the bad

drugs so a contract is incentive line if

all the payoff functions are what are

called e values if you know about P

values from statistics those are tail

probabilities under the null

distribution and E values are non-

negative super Martin Gales under the N

distribution so it's a different way to

quantify uncertainty and it turns out if

and only if contract theory is incentive

in line if and only if the statistics

part is using non- negative Super mar

Gales okay I'm going to finish with two

slides okay so here is uh jumping up

five levels okay my personal view on

this whole AI thing is that it's really

it's not AGI it's not finding you know

the secrets of human intelligence

that'll happen someday I don't I don't

say it won't but humans are way smarter

than our machines right now just way

smarter okay I mean they're smarter in

some ways like a computer can already

calculate all the digits of pi I can't

do that right but there are ways that we

are smarter and will be for quite some

time all right so what's really

happening is there's a new engineering
