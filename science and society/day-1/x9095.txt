already surprising but that means

probably that the center of mass of the

star is is moving around on the on the

CCD chip a little bit now what's

interesting is now if we look at another

star because actually the Kepler

Telescope had a lot of chips and was

measuring I think 200,000 Stars at the

same time if we look at another star

surprisingly sometimes these other stars

look very similar to the first one even

though they are light years away from

the first one of course if that happens

because since there's no connection

between those two stars uh the only

explanation can be the instrument since

the instrument causes both of these

signals so now the question is how do we

uh remove the effect of the instrument

from the sty that we interested in and

then the idea basically was we tried to

predict uh this signal as well as we can

from some other signal of which we know

that astrophysically it should have

nothing in common that means whatever we

can remove by predicting or regressing

on this uh is something that shouldn't

come from the signal but it has to come

from the telescope and uh and we can

prove subject to suitable assumptions we

well we have various results but uh

basically uh under a suitable additivity

assumption we can prove that we can

reconstruct this random variable here

almost surely so it is we reconstruct

the actual random variable not just the

distribution uh up to an offset by uh

regressing this quantity on this one and

subtract rting the

regression so then uh and maybe just

very briefly that or actually I'm going

to skip this one if we if we do

this then uh so we did this and we we

came up with a list of candidates

exoplanets I think it was maybe 30

planets or something like that and then

people were doing follow-up observations

and uh a majority of them was confirmed

using follow-up observations and one of

them was particularly interesting that
