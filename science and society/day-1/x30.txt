blah okay so now you can do that

mathematically and you can get

equilibria that are functions of all of

the parameters like a utility of how

much I care about this how much do I

care about that and you can make little

plots of that parameter that parameter

here's the revenue here's so on so forth

and those are the kind of plots you

could show to a government official and

they will understand them and that's

what economists do in other fields they

make little simple parameters and then

the behavior we could do that with this

really complicated Learning System and

actually now Drive regulatory thinking

at the right level which is the level of

the equilibria okay so we did that in

this paper we actually uh showed how

there's trade-off between the amount of

privacy you offer uh and the um various

aspects of the market behavior and we

were able to show there's a way to get

higher user utility than just kind of

blindly insisting that you don't send

data or you add a certain level of noise

to everything and I think you know the

gdpr is just kind of blind it was not

designed with economic thinking in mind

and gdpr is known to actually hurt small

to medium

businesses okay and the mechanism we're

proposing here will not okay I don't say

it's going to fix all problems but it is

based based on economic thinking last

little part before I finish I'm going to

dig a little bit more into contract

theory so remember Airlines business

class economy class and so on this is

work with colleagues Stephen Michael and

Jake and we're going to bring statistics

into economics now in a real fundamental

way so the statistics is going to bring

the control of errors in an uncertain

environment and the economics is going

to bring the

incentives if you put two together you

can start to solve some real problems

here's a real problem

clinical trials are run in every country
