European focus and the fact that France

is putting a number of means in place to

ensure that it becomes a driving force

in the domain of

AI so look let's get stuck into to our

uh afternoon uh program let's have a

look at those dedicated sessions once

again again we're in the p a I'd like to

start off though by talking about what's

happening underneath uh it is in the

arago aiat there you'll have a session

entitled Frontiers in generative AI now

that Workshop will explore how modern

generative AI is using Cutting Edge

methods to uh well such as Transformers

diffusion processes underpinning that

discussion will also be uh the

foundations of mathematics and the

question of scalability so once again

that is uh taking place in the arago

amphi in the gak aiat we'll be holding a

discussion on the mathematics of machine

learning now that session to be clear

will about be about the interface

between the evolution of machine

learning systems and the greater need

for theoretical tools uh to address just

how rapidly uh that is growing in the

four ampi theat there'll be a title of a

talk rather entitled The Road to a

trustworthy AI

that will be getting underway very

shortly it will delve into the two

essential pillars and again we've spoken

a little bit about that today uh

fairness and privacy when it comes to AI

uh we'll be looking at the challenges of

that and also how we uh stay clear of uh

the question of uh you know unbiased

decisions and uh protecting sensitive

data now here in the pan car uh anatra

we'll start with a symposium on called

Foundation models for Theory to practice

that discussion will explore how

Foundation models have revolutionized AI

during that talk our experts will

explore the challenges in both

interpreting data and doing so

efficiently also how do you collect data

uh efficiently uh Professor Jamal atiff
