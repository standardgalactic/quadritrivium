of future

pandemics topics like this I see several

such problems that I don't think we can

Master without AI so I'm not I'm not

going to I'm not going to guarantee that

we will solve them with AI but for

instance the climate problem I don't see

a political solution maybe Mike can come

up with a mechanism or an automatically

designed mechanism but even then it will

be non-trivial to get countries and

companies to sign up to that mechanism

so I think in the end uh we have to put

a lot of effort into finding

technological solutions for energy

storage energy generation I guess

storage is even more important because

generation is quite cheap now with solar

um and a technological solution probably

also for carbon capture because even if

we slow down the amount of carbon we're

depositing we will still have to remove

some and potentially also a techn

technological solution for maybe even

changing the albo on the planet on a

large scale at some point uh and and

being reactive to these kind of dangers

or or or even dangers such as meteoroid

impact so there are all sorts of global

problems that we cannot address without

so focus on sustainability I hear from

you uh Bernard as what do you think

optimism where do you stand on the

question I am very excited about um uh

human complimentary AI uh I also call it

prum AI so where we can think about AI

really you know enabling enhancing human

flourishing because it helps humans with

you know work or scientific inquiry or

creative tasks to get there I think

needs uh change of priorities change of

vision uh uh and I think very much needs

coupling technology with behavior and

markets uh and that's probably one thing

we share with um mic in terms of why

economics is so Central and social

science uh is so Central in these

discussions but I think there's a hope

and promise to get there but I think it

requires focus on the right vision and
