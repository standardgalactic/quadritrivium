your Target and then it's just the

beginning of the journey because once

you have a you know a candidate drug you

need to optimize it you need to test it

on patients you need to do clinical

trials you need to match it to the right

patients and all of that benefits a lot

from better systems that that that are

smart in terms of understanding matching

a drug to a patients matching the right

biy to patients Etc okay so this is very

promising it's a big business of

opportunity it could be you know like an

an obvious use case for all of these

Technologies the thing is it's hard um

and you know in spite of everything we

can do I mean I think there's a massive

contrast between many of the things

you've been hearing today and and

tomorrow you know AI Can Do Magic um as

of today you know after all smart people

using the best Technologies find a

Target design a drug and finally decide

to test it on patients saying well we're

pretty sure this is the you know the

drug that will cure cancer as of today

90% 90 of the drugs tested on patient

are stopped because they don't work or

because they are toxic okay this is the

level of how smart we are this is the

average success rate of clinical trials

U and so this means there's you know

opportunity to do better but also it's

hard and one reason it's hard is clearly

that biology as a whole you know we

mention genomics but as a whole is

clearly a discipline where we have

accumulated over decad lots of

information lots of knowledge lots of

data but we have very very little

guiding principles you know speaking at

e called poly technque we have I would

say we have no equation for biology it's

very hard to connect the Dos it's very

hard to make quantitative models to

simulate for example a disease so that

you can be rational in desing your drugs

and the end result is that we we use a

lot of trial and errors based on the

best intuition the best tools we have
