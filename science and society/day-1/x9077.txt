using LMS you selects hopefully more

relevant in context examplars and then

you compare to answer well things you

know like the most important thing is

like how it works did it work and so you

know these are you know these are the

examples you know on the first line you

have a traditional Chain of Thought and

on the other one is skill-based Chain of

Thought so you know for example uh you

know compute sinus of 210 you know

similar example with skills would be

sinus of 510 right and so you know you

have something that's getting more and

more similar right for the a chain of

not necessarily was the case

well and of course we did you know

quantitative evaluations on like on you

know typical data set gmsk and you know

we found out this was eventually uh

helpful you know across the board not

that surprising right you have more

relevant example you should get to more

level on things another side to side

comparison let's say you know you want

to have again this assigned to 10 you

know you find some topic based solution

you know there was 210 and um you know

somehow you end up to the wrong problem

because uh because you know it retrieve

you know it it was about the sign right

uh and so but you if use skill based

sign I know this is about trigonometry

and you know particularly K you know the

reasoning reasoning chain or Chain of

Thought you know oh it's is be below the

negative axis so you would not have the

you know sign sign mistake similar you

know similar sign mistake with a

completely different problem what is the

third cube root through Ro of minus 25

not the real number you can not do

impossible you know very confident not

possible to take third route well if you

if your skill is exponent Ro skills it's

much

likely all right and so you know like

you can also ask you know if you can

improve one model improve other and that

we eventually also try you know for
