could happen that a single individual

could never do all that stuff and I'm

just what I'm missing in the dialogue

it's not just social intelligence it's

culture it's interactions it's allowing

new things to do old techn te ology like

civil engineering created buildings and

bridges so people could do new things so

what I hear you saying Mike is is that

the things are missing there are gaps

ultimately that uh need to be addressed

Stephan if I bring you in here because I

think this notion of kind of augmenting

social intelligence is is key what do

you make of that how do we improve and I

think that's what Mike was getting our

understanding of social sciences and

ultimately this idea of collectivity and

not just being individual how do we

improve our Collective

response um so so social intelligence I

mean it's a real question whether AI can

improve it obviously I mean it does

improve communication across cultures

but uh social understanding I mean we've

rather seen a polarization happening for

example on social networks so uh I'm not

so optimistic and one reason is really

trust is uh these uh AI systems are

owned by companies that have their own

interest that may diverge with the

interest of having uh social

interactions which are peaceful uh the

second point about uh AI having the

ability of uh uh putting us all together

in order to act towards common goals uh

there is a real issue here of

interpretability of whatever diagnosis

AI will give us I mean global warming is

an obvious example where you have

science which clearly is interpretable

give you clear elements and still there

is absolutely no consensus about what to

do and there again I'm not so sure that

AI can help now the third point you've

been raising which is social science

here I think that there are very very

interesting uh possibilities because

social science and and I'm going to be

carat all here
