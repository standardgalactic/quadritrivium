agree with the analogy and I think it

can also be seen the reverse way which

is now our large language models are

allowing people to interact with

language with data and types of data and

numbers and code in way that they

previously couldn't unless they had that

um idiosyncratic knowledge um so I

showed an example earlier of a of a

chest x-ray and then you're having a

dialogue with that chest x-ray the

example I gave was a physician having

that dialogue but you can also you know

picture Us in this room right now having

data that previously we couldn't really

understand because we weren't Physicians

or we weren't cists and and we really

have no idea what this thing means and

now because we can interrogate it in

language um there is a way to interface

with a world that was um inaccessible

before and so I really see it both ways

I think it's it's indeed the ability to

convert language into numbers that let

us leverage all of the tools we have

with numbers to better understand a

particular field and also making some of

those fields more uh approachable for

everyone when they're when they don't

necessarily have a particular expertise

um so I think it's a very powerful

analogy we will now welcome PhD students

from The Institute po Technic the Pari

who will ask the final questions

okay uh good afternoon everyone uh nice

to meet you and nice to be here uh you

just mentioned the risk and the

importance of regulations of such as the

AI models so what do you think or what

is the role of the open source models

nowadays in this galaxy of foundational

models and a generative AI thank you so

was the question specifically about risk

in open source um yeah what is what is

the role of these open source models yep

well I I mean I I think I mean obviously

the the concern just to sort of stated

is like you have an open source model

once it's out it's out the horse has
