content which is uh like varying across

species and so you see that again we

improve a bit the protein language model

so the message is the genomics models

has actually all that because it can

guess very well what is the species and

has the context and so this is giving

you a sense of like how much value we

can extract from those models and

ultimately they are additive with

protein language models if you take the

embeddings from both sort of like

concatenate these two models together

you can actually have a result which is

better than each model individually so I

hope this gives you a sense of s of like

the subtle details that go through like

a scientific Journey U building on these

models and building applications but we

didn't stop there you know at heart I'm

passionate about Ai and even though I'm

the CEO of the company I'm still

involved in the research angle because I

think it's fascinating and so one area

we explored is actually inspired by

computer vision we were like you know

segmentation worked very well for uh for

images so segmentation really this isn't

saying like is there a bus in this image

yes but where is the bus can you give me

the exact pixels where the bus is so why

don't we do the same in genomics so we

were among the first to actually try to

segment specific genes like Al like

genomic sequences by looking at having a

classification at a single nucleotide

resolution so there is a lot more

information if you do that because if

I'm just giving you General properties

of a particular DNA strand okay it's not

very useful if I'm having like super

clear images like we have in computer

vision segmentation so that is that is

amazing so we actually inspired ourself

from the work that uh meta and and many

others have done in computer vision and

we did exactly the same for genomics and

guess what it actually works and even

better we were like hey why don't we

build on our early work on the
