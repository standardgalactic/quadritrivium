that uh it come after people and kill

people

well this is a uh more than just a

Sci-Fi in fact uh I didn't see people

seriously establish hypothesis and proof

or evidences in offer substantial that

statement and here I want to add my

thoughts I think when we talk about

agency Free Will moral and drive it is a

different space than having a task and

solving it it is not very clear yet in

our current architecture even have room

to accommodate this kind of capability

and also what kind of data what kind of

task you know uh can be used to attain

that kind of capability so I think maybe

it's not impossible but we're not so

close to reaching that state yet to

close this part let me try to expand the

space of reasoning even further a little

when you see you know say a organ

failure it's more than just going into

the department of liver or brain and get

your uh M skin and then take some

medicine you may want to even look into

the cellar level lesions of your tissue

your DNA mutations and your heritor

histories and so forth all this

information provides you a holistic

picture about what disas is about so it

is biology but understanding biology is

very complicated it is uh you know a

multikill you know a subject go all the

way from nanometer microscopic events to

you know macroscopic events you know in

the order of this size right and in the

past you know uh without the right tool

we take you know a sliced approach you

know uh using you know uh data

collecting at certain resolution and

using models only focusing on one say

well defined problems and these are the
