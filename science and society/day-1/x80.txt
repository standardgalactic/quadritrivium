that incorporates these elements because

they do amazing things and that perhaps

is you know they have amazing feats of

natural language understanding and

generation that might be their most um

you know interesting property but the

other interesting property is that

they're wrong a lot of the time like I

mean we've never built systems uh like

traditional computer systems that that

can be have those kinds of error rates

and like hard to detect error rates so

in some ways maybe the most interesting

Parts about the computer you know both

the systems engineering uh which you

mentioned and then also the human

computer interaction that you mentioned

like we need to build new ways of

thinking about how do we deal with that

level of uncertainty mitigate it and

remove it or how do we surface it for

humans so they can make uh you know have

some understanding and that might also

involve changing the people too if we're

creating calibrated uncertainty

estimates of whether this is right or

not like people have to understand how

to operate with that or you have to

bring it to them so I think there's

actually just a whole world of really

interesting computer science around the

model like the kinds of

cross-disciplinary work that that's been

going on uh in in computer science for a

long time but in some ways maybe the the

the models have sort of taken some of

the air out of the room you know which

is paradoxically you

know you know causing us not to focus on

these kind of cross-sectional things

that I think are are really important

and really interesting so it's been

really fascinating to watch people

building real applications and

Enterprises in our work and and looking

at and I think that we're going to have

huge gains even beyond the the rocket

ship model performance which is going to

continue to increase um in in changing

how we work with them and to make them
