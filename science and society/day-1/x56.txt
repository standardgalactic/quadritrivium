manufacturing it was about building

the information Revolution changed how

we live how we work how we connect with

each other it was about

sharing and now with AI rml it is about

understanding we believe that AI will

power a fundamental social and economic

transformation in the world and it will

do so through the Sciences

so you're probably wondering what does a

scientific revolution from AI look

like and I'd like to start with a very

concrete example in my molecular biology

that Eric already alluded to Alpha

fold proteins are frequently called the

building blocks of life because almost

all biological processes in every living

thing depend on proteins from the

switching of your muscle fibers to the

firing of your

neurons in 1949 frederi San correctly

determined the amino acid sequence of

insulin one particular

protein think of that amino acid

sequence as a string of beads where each

bead is one among 20

letters federick got the Nobel Prize in

1958 for that Discovery and that

Discovery also started molecular biology

as a field

scientists in molecular biology were

then Keen to determine the shape of a

protein its 3D

structure knowing that structure matters

if you want to understand control or

modify a protein's function for example

if you want to predict what molecules

bind to that protein and understand

various biological interactions if you

want to discover new

drugs finding a competitional solution

to that problem problem is far from

trivial it's known as liven thals

Paradox there are about 10 to the^ 300

confirmations that the typical protein

can take enumerating all possibilities

would take longer than the age of the

universe and yet somehow in nature

proteins fold spontanously within

milliseconds protein three-dimensional
