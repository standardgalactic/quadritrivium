first day of the AI action Summit and

that's probably one of the thing that

I'm the proudest of that we're hosting

this conference here in France thanks to

the amazing support um of Institute poly

technique de of e poly technique Deora

and everyone who has made this event

possible the number of people who have

come together at the top of their field

when it comes to AI is absolutely

incredible and the fact that this is

happening here in France is a very

strong sign on how important are how

critical this conference about AI will

be and the ambition and level of

ambition that we want we want to put on

this technology so thanks for taking the

time to help us think through this

technology because this is only with

such conversations that our governments

our companies our citizens can really

get at the top of the field and really

ask themselves the right questions so

I'm not a scientist um and I won't be

able to go as much into the technical

aspect of the technology as some of the

brightest mind on the planet when it

comes to a I have been doing uh the

whole day but um it was very important

for me to be able to share a few words

with you because um this is an

incredible moment for friends and an

incredible moment for

AI the presence of such outstanding

researchers and experts here today is a

testament to the V Vitality of AI

research and its immense potential to

shape our

future I would like obviously to to

thank as well H Paris um and all the

work that has been done is making in

making this conference possible it's a

unique

opportunity for us I think for all of us

to explore the scientific technological

societal challenges of

AI to share ideas on how this technology

with Will evolve to confront ideas that

sometimes are not necessarily the same

on the evolution of the technical aspect
