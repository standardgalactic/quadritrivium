policy makers have about AI that

prevents them from regulating it

efficiently and how should we address

them okay one person who's particularly

passionate about that answer do you want

to go ahead yeah so the idea that AI is

intrinsically dangerous and can lead to

human extension that's a complete

fallacy it's just it's just false and it

leads governments to um regulate

research and development and basically

have Tendencies to make open source and

um open research illegal I think that's

extremely

dangerous okay thank you very much Yan

and the second question if you will okay

so my question is more about education

and also to you as professors like in

the domain of AI so like research is

really advancing and uh the titles of

papers uh might look um incomprehensible

for someone who graduate ated 10 years

ago um so like what should um like uh

students who like go into this field

because we don't know what they're going

to have when they graduate should they

learn and uh that will uh be stand the

test of time and more broadly in

education in general like what like

teacher should uh teach especially that

now uh students uh use AI tools to do uh

their home Works uh so I think like that

education how should the it change just

the same message from centuries ago

learn learn math yeah no learn math

learn how to think learn how to think

abstractly you know and yes these tools

they may do the calculus problem but who

cares they just build on top of that

just like with calculators you don't

have to do the arithmetic you can now

build on top of that but just keep going

uh every little bit math I've ever

learned is made me given me pleasure and

it's been useful in my life and it's

allowed me to connect to people yeah

music and math those are the two things

to do yeah I like this answer especially

that you are here of the ma if I may

just maybe add math of course but
