what basan statistics would call the

prior and this is sometimes used as a

justification if you have exchangeable

data then you can pretend there there's

a prior and you you condition I you

generate IID conditioned on the prior

and um the Theta summarizes the

dependent structure that makes this data

non

IID so given Theta everything is is

independent now

um let's uh generalize this to a causal

case so now we have two variables X and

Y and we think of X as causing y so we

have a sequence of such pairs

exchangeable segments of such Pairs and

let's not look at the Assumption yet

let's just look at the

theorem so the theorem says that if you

have an exchangeable sequence of pairs

of random variables um subject to a

condition then it can be represented as

a mixture of conditionally IID sequences

that share an invariant underlying

causal factorization corresponding to X

causing y so that means you have uh one

variable here one prior one latent

variable U which is a conditioning

variable for the generation of X and

then you have another one that controls

the process that generates y from X so

we generate X then we generate y from X

so X is causing y uh and the two

processes are independent from each

other in in the sense that this is just

a a product of two probability measures

and uh and what's the assumption that we

need for this to be

true the Assumption actually uh is

something that we can think of as a

formalization of this independent causal

mechanis

assumption the assumption is written

here so this notation here denotes All

Points all numbers from one through all

integers from 1 through n so these are

all the output labels or all the effect

labels these are all the cause labels

and this uh tells

us that given the direct parents so that
