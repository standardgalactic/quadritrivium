can just also ask llm to find out and so

we can just give a question we just ask

simply a l for a skill and concept that

it was used to solve a question so here

is like you know a car travels at a

constant speed and covers the distance

to 40 blah blah blah blah blah you know

what's the speed right and a skill and a

skill is speed distance time calculation

you know but the reason is because you

need to have expertise in speed and

distance

calculation well you know some other

example sum of the two numbers is 45

well that's solving linear equation you

know how many whole blocks needs to be

to be a r like you can calculate volumes

uh and so on and so and you know and

this is this knowledge so this was these

are example are from uh gp4 but here in

the friends that we want to you know

support the student coming from poly

technique so we also try Mixr and uh and

they also you know uh you're able to get

the skills and it's somehow they're Nam

differently we also you know in our

paper we we even try to have skills from

one model and using other models this

also works uh but

you know this evidence that I just

presented is just very qualitative right

we we couldn't just you know uh use it

quantitatively because we don't have

access to the true label we don't

actually know that if llm said I used

you know volume it actually used

something else right or if it use

anything at all uh but the most

important things like so how we can rely

on this dstream valuation to improve

llms so I'll be very specific how we can

use it and this is actually several

these specific examples and the way uh

apply them we use in several several

companies that I advise and so one of

them is ICL in context learning so we

provide more examples in context for

solving new problems and other ones how

to actually be order you know things

what we learn such what we already don't
