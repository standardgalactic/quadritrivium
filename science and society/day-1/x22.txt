connect people and we want to connect

people with machines and we want to

connect things that give value to people

and to entities all right but if we just

connect things will do what Facebook did

we'll connect things and make us a mess

sorry again y but nonetheless I got to

say that um all right why do people want

to connect and what prevents them from

lying well nothing prevents from them

lying I think there's some lying going

on Facebook I'm not sure about this but

I think there's a little bit of lying

going

on okay so we need something more

sophisticated than just connect things

up and make predictions we need some

more statistics and we need some more

economics all right so just one last

slide on kind of you know provocative

statements here but here's what I think

Sam Alman has in mind or Alon musk or

whatever is I take all of Humanity's

knowledge that they're producing on the

internet that I just take for free grab

it and I create this super AGI thing

that can answer any question it knows

everything right and so we Humanity

saved because we can ask about how do I

solve climate change or how do I get to

rub very fast or whatever question I

want and it'll tell me now we'll spend a

huge billions and trillions of dollars

to get that thing but once we have it

we've saved Humanity right this is

nonsense this is nonsense I don't want

something up there telling me what to do

it doesn't know my current situation

doesn't know my current context doesn't

know what I might want in the moment I

want to be like in a market where I get

to kind of look around and think and

interact and uh be a human being and I

want these machines to be in the market

too because they'll know some things I

know don't know I'll be happy to

interact with machines but they got to

kind of talk some of my language

uncertainty uh information asymmetries

and so on so forth so I Want It All
