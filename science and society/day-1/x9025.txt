go let do you watch a drama series if so

which one yeah I do there are so many

good ones out there okay and now the

last thing and the most recent thing we

did is with the same architecture we

could turn it into a translation system

so now the input audio is from The

Source language and then the output

audio is in the target language and the

actual textt stream is also translation

in text so in this case we and it turns

out that we managed to train an actual

system of this type to do French to

English uh it does simultaneous

simultaneous translation in the way a

human interpreter does on the fly as you

start talking okay um and you have also

the transcription I'm just going to show

you two examples of that starting with

this one so it's called iiki the system

it means Eco in Japanese uh so again

simultaneous speech to speech

translation uh and you are going to see

here Xavier de laort uh the uh

journalist who does the L on on the

public radio is is actually talking

about um about translation and you will

hear the uh English version on top of

his voice it's not very easy I should

change the the balance to to let you

hear the two uh channels but try to well

try to split your brain

comp and I would like to change slightly

the balance and I will be done with that

where is sound up where is my sound

and instead let me show you the actual

uh uh key player or or the very

important person in this project with

the the the student who whose project

was the starting of of this IB

new um model of ours so this is Tom and

is actually showing the same thing

working on the mobile phone so again

it's translated on the fly as he

speaks hi name is Tom and I'm

engineering school my final research

project was to work on a

real translation system of speech the

system we develop reproduces the voice

of the user speaking in French
