one um and things are noisy so it's a

non-trivial data analysis this problem

and we do it Based on data uh we did it

Based on data from the kepo Space

Telescope space is a telescope orbiting

or still orbiting sun on an earth

trailing orbit and uh it was staring at

the same patch of Milky Way for for

several years um but then at some point

and that was maybe lucky for us at some

point it had four reaction Wheels to

orient itself in 3D for to have some

redundancy at some point one of them

broke that was still okay and then

another one broke so it couldn't be

controlled anymore but the engineers at

Nasa had this idea to use the remaining

fuel in the thrusters to still somehow

control the telescope so they couldn't

point it so precisely anymore you have

to make Corrections because the solar

radiation pressure changes Etc um but

they thought let's while we have fuel

let's look at as many uh additional

targets as possible so they produced

this data set and shared it all openly

which was fantastic

and then uh we immediately ran our

method that we had developed already

before based on the previous campaign of

Kepler data and uh the method is the

following so we um we wrote down a

generative model or a causal generative

model I think every generative

model if it's generative in a physical

sense is a causal model um for the

observations so each observation is of

course influenced or caused by the

astrophysical signal that we're

interested in uh it's also influenced by

the properties of the instrument so if

the instrument points in a slightly

different direction it's going to affect

what we measure and then it turns out

the light of a star is uh deliberately

spread out of multiple pixels so all

these pixels actually record the same

star in each of these light curves goes

over three months so you can see some of

them go down some of them go up that's
