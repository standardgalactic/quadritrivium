tools we use right and uh it is not

working very well that's in fact you

know we still you know uh don't

understand very well about biology and

designing a drug and treating a disease

still is difficult but nowadays we have

a better models or maybe more power

models what's the implication for

example we see one implication already

right you can now solve this puzzle of

proing structure like we never did

before in a very very efficient and

accurate fashion and very fast and uh

it's remember it's important to remember

that arha 42 does not understand the law

of physics okay it is a purely data

driven approach that gives you a input

output mapping between the sequence and

the structure by train on many many you

know uh collection of large data and

it's a very different approach empirical

one empiricist one against the first

principle one in solving a big piece of

puzzle in science and it is recognized

by Nobel Prize and uh this two contrast

is very very important to recognize

because uh first principle approach

however elegant is s it gives you

uncertainty of quantification

quantification of uncertainty Clarity

explainability but it is not scalable to

many of the problems we want to solve

even now whereas the a found models

gives you that capability in terms of

the outcome even though it is not quite

satisfying all the scientific curiosity

and also the clarity and causality but I

think there is a middle ground that we

can leave up with both and let the two

approach to naturally merge rather than

waiting you know way each other so in

that vein there has been a lot of uh

amazing developments in the past several

months in fact using Foundation models

in biology and this is one effort one to

highlight which is called a AI driven

digital organism which is not about just

building one model for one type of data

but building a cluster or system of

models that covers different aspects of
