can say oh given that procedure um I'm

going to use my internal knowledge to

decide that this set of proteins I'm

going to go ahead and send in because

there's a chance that even if they don't

really work they'll pass the false

positive barrier and they'll get onto

Market at least for a year or two until

everybody realizes they're no good and

come companies do this all the

time okay all right so I have a slide

here which I'm going to skip but um um

for one a time um but here's here's an

actual some numbers that show you how

pharmaceutical companies can gain the

system um you know and so the top part

of is the statisticians you know name

and Pearson Testing uh doing it right uh

controlling errors and the bottom part

is the economics which is that if a

small profit is to be made the CEO can

reason in one way and if a large profit

is to be made the CEO can reason a

different way and she could figure out

whether I should incentivize my people

to send in lots of proteins or not so

many and in the one case she will lose

money uh if she does it wrong so she

doesn't in the other case she'll just

make money for free because the false

positive rate is is uh is low enough

that she could just do she could just

send things in so you can gain the

system just a long story short and I'm

this happens all the time there are

plenty of drugs on the market which are

not effective

so we have a new Theory we call it

statistical contract theory again I

won't get into details here but I just

want to show you a little algorithm uh

this is a contract in contract theory um

an agent which is now a pharmaceutical

company is given an opt-in protocol if

you want to send in a drug candidate you

either can walk away when you look at

this protocol or you can pay a

reservation price R like 20 you know $2

million and now you get to choose a

payout function from a menu of payout
