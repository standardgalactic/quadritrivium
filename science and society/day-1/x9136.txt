uh regulation I suppose uh

uh here clearly there is a difference

between an American and European

approach to the problem but if you if

you think about the system that even you

want to regulate regulation is part of

the experiment if you only wait at the

end to regulate you will have no idea

how to regulate the regulation is things

that has to be growing progressively as

things are going in otherwise the day

you regulate you're going to mess up

completely and it's going to be too

brutal so I have a tendency to believe

that regulation is indeed part of the

system anyway companies are regulated

there are regulations all over so the

question is always a bit more a bit less

and obviously this is a divide going

across Atlantic here I mean that

dichotomy between you know perhaps a US

view or or a European view but it'll be

interesting to get your Insight there do

we regulate first or later I mean at

what stage do we regulate

well I think it's uh so if we look at

how it was done in

Europe I think there were consultations

so they tried to get technical expertise

uh maybe not everybody in the technical

field thought they got sufficient

technical expertise and one thing that

kind of surprised me was that uh many of

the people that I talked to who were

involved in the regulation they were

really proud that they were the first

ones to regulate and and then I I felt

slightly uncomfortable thought oh so

we're Europe we're really proud that

we're the fastest to regulate so uh

maybe that's that's that's the one

extreme The Other Extreme we just

experiment and break it and and probably

both sides can learn something from each

other so regulating in a vacuum doesn't

make it make any sense because nobody

can predict the developments so okay all

right so find some uh Common Ground

there I hear you say just add add as a

person from us maybe trying to uh I
