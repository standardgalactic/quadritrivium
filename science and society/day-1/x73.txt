we ended up having a a beautiful um uh

visual representation of the discrepancy

between between Physicians and they were

all board certified so very you know

nothing against them like very capable

Physicians but it's just really hard for

a human to judge the images and we even

made a t-shirt out of that metrics

because it was so telling that it's hard

to establish a grand truth and so I

think that difficulty is even more

Amplified in generative AI where really

establishing those those benchmarks is

tricky and is also um very specific to a

particular context so in in the US for

example the field is quite advanced so

many different groups have started on

that Journey but in many countries of

the world people haven't really started

to think of the ways they will want to

evaluate those

models maybe I could just step in uh and

add to um add to those points I mean I

think one challenge that we sometimes

see across domains is that the volume of

data that we have available for text

isn't available in other domains it can

be harder to get any data can be hard

like there are cases where the that

amount of data doesn't exist in the

world humans haven't even produced that

much um for certain kinds of things so

there's a there's an interesting

mismatch there that I think um sometimes

um you know companies for instance will

struggle with where they they want to do

the AI thing but they actually have

relatively small volumes of data but

then at the same time there's something

really interesting about how almost

every domain and modality we have can be

mapped into language to some extent

and it's sort of wild that we can just

sort of project images time series

whatever we want to project you just

project it into the space of this

language model and I think it's actually

saying something kind of profound about

our ability to express lots of different

things including kind of outof domain
