dialogue on llms to me is missing some

fundamental things there's no focus on

collectives whatsoever it's all about

who can build build the biggest machine

there's no Focus uncertainty or very bad

focus on uncertainty and there's no

focus on incentives why should people

want to play this game why should they

want to be involved in this whole thing

just because they're being told to by

their boss and these three three things

are

linked okay so microeconomics talks

about all three of them and links them

in interesting ways now micro economics

does not solve all the problems it's got

to be refurbished brought out from its

Origins and made more data aware more

learning aware and so on it's a huge

intellectual agenda for the next 10 20

years to me in doing that it's a

complimentary kind of intelligence when

you create a market with a collective

you don't create it no person designed

it it emerges and it's happen throughout

history all the time very interesting

different kind of markets have Arisen in

very many different kinds of things that

market is an intelligent

entity it brings food into the City of

Paris every day the right amount not too

much not too little if it's raining or

shining what whatever the size of Paris

over the years you know there Zola wrote

about the theal where you know the food

that comes into Paris and the whole

machine that does that that's an

intelligent entity now when you say that

the phrase AGI which I particularly

hate uh is that market and form of

AGI well no one talks that language they

seem to apply that AGI is everything but

it doesn't seem to have anything to do

with markets so I don't I don't get it

as you can see I have opinions I'm

old okay now uncertainty uh we have a

bunch of statisticians in the room I

really am a statistician just to say

number one that's to me the the mother

field that's where it
