to what the Black Box can tell you it's

a whole Enterprise around these black

boxes these llms and all this these

don't solve the problem they're a little

tool that if you put a lot of other

stuff around it it helps but there'll

always be bias and sometimes bias is

good and well instance that Mike is is

bias a good thing oh sometimes bias is

good because you're biased to see a

certain pattern that actually is going

to occur it's it's a bias it's not

necessarily going to be true but it it

is you know it it is it you know being

unbiased is kind of a meaningless

concept a useless concept it's how to be

biased okay at the right time in the

right way be contextual be individual

don't just do one rule for everybody so

it's unbiased on average across

everybody no make it different for

different people because it'll be better

for people

social welfare that's again it's

economics the concepts we need are ones

that come about the aggregate the

collective and they will always be

biased and that's that's that's

desirable I want price discrimination

I'm a little older I want to be able to

get a cheaper seat in the movie theater

right um what's wrong with that it's

it's good really for everybody sure sure

sure so so evoking kind of not the

positivity of bias but saying that it's

actually not that bad and it can be

beneficial at time we use these words

just too broadly we use these two words

too broadly you know bias is bad ethics

is good you know social s we're just

using these buzzwords where there's

nothing behind

it and technology is bad orms are bad

good bad it's it's it's this 50s style

dialogue and and it's also interesting

that we we have this tendency to

automatically associate whatever is

negative with machines and I think so we

see a lot of negative things that might

happen but I like I like the optimism
