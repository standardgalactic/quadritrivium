Got Musicians here who are making music

we got listeners sitting over there as

another side leg of the triangle and now

critically there are Brands involved

here brands have money and they have

goals all right so in particular the NBA

has signed on with United Masters what's

that mean if you go to the NBA website

and you watch a little clip often

there's music behind it okay and it used

to be that the NBA paid Beyonce or

whatever a vast sum of money for that

music now they go to the United Masters

and they say give me some music United

Masters is a very good recommendation

system and can say oh for that kind of

purpose that kind of audience in

demographic here's a good kind of music

they stream it the musician get paid in

that moment all right then there's other

brands involved as well they watch all

of this it's an open market and they say

oh that artist seems to be popular on

the NBA website that's my demographic

I'm going to reach out to that artist

and work with them too this has been now

happening for five years there are three

million musicians who are making money

off of this platform right now okay this

is and Running Company that is really

really working and it is getting people

paid for Creative

acts right and it's critical that it's a

three-way Market if it's a two-way

Market you got something more like

Spotify which is that some artists make

some music it gets streamed out there

and where's the money come from there

are no Brands there's no one willing to

pay anything um well okay I'll try to

make a little money with subscriptions

and I'll throw a little bit of change

back at the few artists it's not a real

Market okay um and so that doesn't work

and moreover that incentivizes Spotify

to get rid of those artists why don't I

put gen AI in there to make the music

because I can get that for free it

incentivizes that kind of activity it's

damaging to the human species three-way
