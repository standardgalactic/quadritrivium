given all the causes X1 through xn we

will not gain additional information

about all the effects if someone gives

us an additional input of the causes so

that means in this sense additional

knowledge about the cause distribution

so this additional Point even just one

point doesn't tell you more about the

the regularity of effect given the cause

so that you can think of this as one

formalization and uh and the whole thing

can also be generalized to a

multivariate case so if you have a

general uh dag uh only that the

condition looks a lot more complicated

but it's still an i c m type condition

so what's important is uh in the

exchangeable but non IID case we can

sometimes identify C the structure from

data um and I think this is a nice way

to think about things and uh and we've

since then also generalized it and and

and studied what happens or what kind of

consequences does this give you for the

estimation of causal effects in

exchangeable

data and uh and we're starting to think

about the connection connections to

representation

learning so uh a little bit of

mathematics since I'm e called poly

Technic and now it's going to get much

more

applied but still about

causality and uh I'm going to back to my

favorite theme of astronomy and

uh I'm going to tell you about uh what I

think is an interesting causal model for

the removal of systematic errors in in

exoplanet detection and uh in this uh

application here we're detecting

exoplanets from transits so that means

uh you look at a star and the the the

plane of the orbit of an exoplanet that

we can't see directly is aligned with

our line of sight and every so often

this exoplanet partially occludes the

host star now the exoplanet is probably

a lot smaller than the host star um so

this um occlusion might be a very small
