which leads to the the such a pride in

human civilization and the human being

uh for example there is a famous

conversation happened right here in

France in between Napoleon and laas

Napoleon asked hey do you really need uh

the mentioning of a God in in your

system and plus proudly answered that we

don't need that assumption so basically

there is a belief that with first

principle and with science we can solve

the everything in Universe if now now

but then sometime in the future then

comes to some other little what we call

the little Cloud you know in the air

which includes some of this uh Global GL

resis for example uh it's causal

reasoning really uh you know uh true you

know everywhere there are a few cases in

fact they were challenged you know you

all heard about the general theory of

relativity one of the bigger consequence

of that is that you may be able to do

time travel and when you do time travel

the ciety kind of argument becomes shaky

right and also evolution is not about C

in fact the nature mother nature never

evolves species toward a certain goal by

designing the best possible mutation by

having the best possible protein design

to achieve certain functions like a

catalyzation right it is through random

mutation and there is a selection Force

which is rather indeterministic at the

microscopic level and the quantum super

position which was uh reflected in the

shoting girls cat you know uh story same

thing even the natural word you know is

no longer exist out outside of a human

mind independently depending on what you

observe you may have different physical

realities and there are Al also you know

incompleteness in mathematical theory

about coexistence of consistency and

correctness so all this basically push

people maybe to give a you know

opportunity to think Beyond using only

first approach I think AI is one of

these examples or maybe a good examples

we still don't know know exactly how you
