on a very narrow band of innovation and

our plan is to add both breath and depth

into the offering and also into of

activity for example in the next 5 years

we're going to add two new colleges in

public health and in Deion science and

uh after that we'll be adding back the

Arts and Sciences and also the

engineering but in a way that is

different from the way we did people do

nowadays because these are a vision as

mentioned coming from the 50s and now

with the AI which provides you

encyclopedic knowledge right next to

your fingertip how can you rethink about

the skill how do you rethink about the

Innovation and doing your job can be

very different right so we want to make

sure that our education and the

university infrastructure are prepared

maybe even stay the head of the game to

get the uh trainees ready for their job

so with that you know I hope I set a

stage you know for the talk uh because

uh the technical material that I'm going

to present actually came from our work

from this very University which was

actually not quite possible you know

elsewhere in the world in the

traditional school because of uh

resource limitation because the you know

uh traditional incentivization

mechanisms in University which counts

papers you know or cons other things and

here we're thinking about or talking

about how to maximize the impact of AI

and how to execute even

faster right so just a quick recap what

is happening now you know in the AI

World well this is happening last year

you know uh we got this great you know a

boost you know in our field which is

that you know our foundational work and

our applicational impacts gets

recognized you know by you know uh you

know honors you know as prestigious as a

Nobel Prize and that act announcement

come right in the middle of uh my own

presentation in a workshop promoting you

know AI applications in biology so it
