know you you know you discover in

physics or in economy right and so in

that case I actually don't want for my

rack for my Inc Contex example something

that's coming from biology I would like

something that is apply the same skill

right that's why we go to school and try

to not to be only specific but you know

kind of know everything little bit of

everything uh and so this is this is

also a good F of to apply also when we

work with llms

and so these are examples that you know

like the when things are not working out

and know this is you know these are real

examples you know from CHP uh all right

and so the one thing that uh we do it

will classifies those skills and try to

you know match and retrieve you know our

in context examples from those skills

and so you know except you know consider

ex like access to these Exemplar

repository skills like you know for this

question answer this skill is applied

for this question answer this skill is

let's just say there is only one skill

of course usually have much more and so

we'll do very simple procedure you know

how actually we make better uh better

answers so first reliable question with

skills that could be you know that could

be somehow difficult because it could be

two fine grain then we combine similar

skill to the one skill so there's a

better sharing so you know as Mike was

saying at the beginning like the llms

are kind of big information sharing

machines you know like the in people

share information but you know we have

as a humankind access to information

that was shared by everybody and so we

also want to combine those skills and so

here we just do a simple clustering uh

and then we relabel our question

aggregated skill categories so

specifically you know and for all of

these things we'll just just llms you

know similar as emad did uh earlier in

the morning we ask llms for the skills

output right so this is the question
