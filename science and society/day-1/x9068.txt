accurate I would say so we see the trend

now that uh there is room for a bit more

I don't like the word but blackbox

discoveries that turn out to work well

and then we can do some a poster

justification of why it's not

stupid actually I have a question for

you y how do you deal with data privacy

if there is an issue with privacy yes of

course so um one of the so a big

difference I would say uh working in

that domain versus llms if I simplify uh

is the data doesn't come from the web

some of it comes from the web DNA

proteins there are lots because you know

it's not even human like most of the

proteins you or DNA you can get is a is

is what you sample in in in the in the

world but as soon as we go towards

patients tissues Etc of course these are

patient data so you we I mean we are

super careful about that meaning we work

with hospitals for It's Complicated

right with each Hospital there are

contracts there are ways to anonymize

synonymize to use the data for specific

use case to store them on the right data

centers Etc so I would say it's

complicated but for good reason which is

you know patient privacy and protection
