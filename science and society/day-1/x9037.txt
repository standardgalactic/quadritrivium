use synthetic data but um but being able

to build the tooling to bring it

together I think is potentially very

profound and it's something that we'd

like to do with the community um around

um you know if we look then to the next

opportunity um you know we've been

training our models all on public data

and I you know I think you could argue

that basically all of the public data

that's out there has been been put into

models you know in one way or another

but if you actually look at the data

that's in your own company like almost

none of that's made it into model

hopefully it's not much of it is in

public models because that means your

data got out in the public somehow and

somebody slurped it up um so we think

that's a huge opportunity because this

is the real competitive differentiation

of any business is is you have your data

you have your knowhow could you use that

and that's what this project instruct

lab does so this is a very similar idea

except it doesn't require any coding at

all uh you can do very simple sort of

give examples amplify that with

synthetic data generation using LM

workflows and you know you can basically

then create a master set and the key

here is not so much anything about the

technology there are a few details about

how the training is done that makes it

work a little bit better but really the

key thing is that it makes it makes it

all easy and TurnKey and automated so

subject matter experts don't have to

learn anything and they can can just

focus on outcomes and why is this

important it's because

if you can take a model and customize it

knowing your company's problem your

company's uh data um you can actually

perform a task incredibly effectively

I'm just going to for the sake of time

focus on the last uh row on the right

where basically this uh was a North

American telecommunications company they

were doing a task where they were taking
