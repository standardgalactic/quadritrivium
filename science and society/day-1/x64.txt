pipeline which follows a more randomized

approach based on chemical

formulas and the outputs then are

evaluated using established density

functional

Theory those are then added to the

database which informs the N next round

of active

learning and in a way that's quite

similar to what happened with Casp in

the alpha fold example once we finished

that Discovery effort we then searched

the scientific literature and we found

73 six of our computational discoveries

that were independently realized by

external teams around the globe so you

see those examples on the right a first

of It kind kind alkaline earth

diamondlike Optical material for example

and a potential

superconductor we've released that

database of newly discovered crystals to

the research

Community it is giving scientists a

catalog of promising recipes for new

candidates and we hope it will help them

test and potentially make make the best

ones historically weather forecasting is

done through numerical weather

prediction it leverages physics to

simulate atmospheric

behavior and we use observational data

from weather stations and satellites so

the temperature the wind sped

Etc these models process that data with

supercomputers performing complex and

timeconsuming

calculations we've trained a few

different AI models to improve weather

predictions graph Gast for example is

strained on historical data from the

European Center of medium range weather

forecasts and it delivers 10-day weather

predictions at unprecedented accuracy in

under one minute compared to the hours

needing needed when using a conventional

approach and weather next offers earlier

War ings of extreme weather events this

is our latest weather

model if you think of cyclones also
