it generate an art gallery and then it

comes up with this image here which

looks plausible but of course it's very

different from the original image that

God came in when we generated before we

generated

segmentation and uh similar kind of

conditioning here this is a system uh

which uses a particular kind of athal

fine tuning on this problem where you

you you have one particular object that

you sort of bind to a token and then you

can use it in the text prompt and then

you can so so you have this Max plunk

cup and you can generate Newton with

this mug uh you can uh generate touring

interestingly

touring very secretive the system it

doesn't put the logo on the cup and for

Einstein this is another example of this

kind of leakage and correlation Einstein

I think such a dominant correlational

presence that he decided to put his face

also onto onto the

mar so let me take a step back with a

few General

thoughts so if we think about uh causal

representations uh or representations in

general so uh they're very different

types of representations or or of what

you could ask of a representation so

this is an image of the the atom model

so before quantum mechanics the

predominant model of of an Hydro of or

of an atom in general was kind of a

generalization of of of planets orbiting

Suns so people thought there's the core

and the electrons they're going around

an

orbit and uh if you read the

autobiography of Heisenberg he said for

him the crucial moment when quantum

mechanics or or the Matrix calculus was

found was that he completely disposed of

this image and said let's just worry

about what's actually observable so this

was also influenced by positivism which

was popular at the time in Vienna

especially um so let's just look at

what's observable and let's relate the
