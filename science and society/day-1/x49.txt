sketchy of a potential architecture

design down the road where you know the

word model which is a bigger version of

the large language model built on

multimodal data can be itself a model

module inside a agent model along with

other representations like the goal the

belief and also the plans and also you

know interface with the external tools

and other things you can even you know

build a community as mik mentioned you

know or you know a collective uh you

know uh uh group of Agents which gives

you you know this uh more Collective

Behavior you know in a abstracted way

then you have a super agents which can

make microeconomic you know or societal

decisions based on the

situations so again I couldn't play this

movie I guess and uh what is happening

here is that I want you to imagine what

a a gentic and a physical world look

like oh it is playing right it is

actually not what you see in Sora and uh

in Gemini 2 you know a geni 2 where you

see cool you know visual effects and the

cool you know uh uh movies and the 3D

rations of uh the reality a agentic word

is a word that you experience in real

life where this particular guy you can

see that he is running he actually is

interacting you know with the object you

know inside the World Imagine That when

you drive if you treat the coming car as

a object versus you treat the car as a

agent which has its own plan its own

intention I bet your behavior will be

very different you may run away from it

you may stop you may just uh you know uh

go ahead on who who knows but if it's a

object you don't actually feel that

complicated to avoid traffic right so

that's basically what I see to be a

promising Direction an important one

down the road for the AI system to go

Beyonds I want to have a word about uh

whether we should be afraid of this or

not there are a lot of uh discussions

and uh and uh speculations about uh you

know the AI system become so powerful
