numbers that's how I see it and maybe

it's a bit simplistic but all these

embeddings like the English language the

French language becames numbers and so

when you become numbers you you're

you're amenable to processing and so on

and so I'm kind of Blown Away by what

people do with this new reality which is

is that text is now numbers and so we

can create new tools that we could not

really create before before text became

numbers so at Stanford and of course I

don't have your expertise your your your

um in all these fields but you know like

we are putting out a little system that

just says okay you know here are a bunch

of data sets here are some medical

hypothesis you might be interested in so

it's a

very um scientific hypthesis is this

Gene regulating this thing you know or

is this Gene associated with this

phenotype or things like that and so you

have data sets and because English

became text um then you can take these

hypothesis look at the consequence of

this hypothesis things that can be

actually tested on database you

have and then because text is numbers

then you can actually write statistical

program from scratch that will actually

test these hypothesis fairly

rigorously and so we we designed a with

Yori Lovich and our students we designed

a system that does something like that

and then of course we compareed this

with human evaluation like professional

biostatisticians whose job it is and

because these tasks

are sufficiently mundane then we can see

that you know the system does actually

well and I think it's very useful

because as now as the universe of things

that we need to explore is getting

larger and larger there's no way we're

going to be able to have humans explore

all corners of Neuroscience or or

biology and so when these things are

simple enough um to be automated I think

that's but I think again I'm going to
