think there's a a real danger in saying

like Okay you know you know there are

there are people um in various countries

and and people lobbying to say like oh

we should stop we should shut down open

sort of sharing of models and I I think

honestly that'll have the exact opposite

effect yeah to Echo what you're saying

and I think for us I presented Alpha

fold earlier and the availability of the

protein debt Bank was absolutely

instrumental in being able to get to

something like Alpha fold and when we

release Alpha fold we did it in stages

right to Monitor and make sure and

consulted with the external community

and so I think you really have to think

um in a stepbystep manner and also

engage uh many stakeholders not just the

people releasing the models but the

broader civil society and governments

the all stakeholders when you're making

those decisions when it comes to open

models um we've built Gemma which is

like the small version if you wish of

our Gemini model um and I need to

mention it here because it's actually

partially built by people in Paris so

we're very proud of that and um and it's

a very capable model which was when we

made it available to developers we in

parallel made available a responsible

toolkit and I think it's also very

important to give people the tools to

then you know build upon those

foundational models but know what to

expect know what type of threat modeling

you need to do so that you can then

protect yourself and the you know what

you're going to build on top of that

model against misuse um and so it's it's

I think not enough to just say I'm I'm

put throwing something over the fence

and people will do whatever they want

right you have to Mone you have to

engage with society and you have to

provide also all the tools needed to

then use that model responsibly yeah

yeah I I do want to add a few words

thank you for this question because uh
