different kinds of observations to each

other try to find a structure with h

without hypothesizing something that we

we have no direct access to anyway so it

feels a bit like they were doing to end

training as opposed to uh generative

modeling and

identification

um here's an not completely different

example this is about something that uh

ethologists call a cognitive map so you

have a rat and you know rats are very

good at navigating in space you know

they live in complicated underground

settings sometimes um so if the rat were

always to go from A to B it wouldn't

need a map but uh if you have a rep

presentation uh it's it's a versatile

thing that you can you can use it for

supporting different types of navigation

connecting different points um that you

maybe have never worked in this

combination before and animals have to

do this using limited resources Hardware

energy consumption and also time so how

should you structure a representation to

cover such multiple situations and tasks

and uh and I think if these uh if these

tasks share building blocks due to the

way they are they arise in the world so

if they are composed of of components

that uh um correspond to causal physical

laws then these building blocks they

might suggest a corresponding structure

uh of the representation that the animal

is using uh because that would increase

the chances that a component is reusable

ac across a range of different

situations so that means if the world is

modular

uh in the sense that you have different

components in the world that play uh

roles across a range of different

environments or tasks or settings then

then it would make sense

for a model to apply to uh to use

different sorry to use similar kinds of

modules and I think that could also be

an idea for for learning such systems so

I'm going to skip this but
