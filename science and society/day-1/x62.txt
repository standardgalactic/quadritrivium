complex an alpha go learned to play Go

by playing against itself millions of

times to test its skills we played

against the 18 time world champion go

player Ley doll more than 200 million

people watch the game and Alpha go won

for to

one it didn't just win but it also came

up with creative strategies never seen

before for example the famous move

37 in which it put a stone on the Fifth

Line very unheard of and all the experts

thought it was a mistake but it wasn't

so alphago happened at a critical point

to really demonstrate that the learning

systems are able to learn something

useful Alpha go and Alpha fold have

three ingredients in common they're the

key ingredients we like to see before we

tackle a challenge with

AI a massive Comal search space where

neural networks can very effectively

guide the search a clear objective

function or metric to optimize or to

heal climb

against and third either lots of data or

an accurate and efficient

simulator and in parallel we see that

advancing the frontier in science

requires

dealing with tremendous scale and

tremendous

complexity so it's not surprising that

over the years we've seen also a

tremendous increase in AI adoption

Across The Sciences spending all the

Sciences agriculture biology chemistry

geology mathematics physics

Etc and I'd like now to take the

remaining of my talk to show you a

handful of examples across those

domains besides leveraging Alpha fold

for drug Discovery we're also using Ai

and generative AI to make more accurate

diagnosis for example in rology to

remove administrative burden for example

by automatically taking notes or writing

summaries and to help comprehend massive

amounts of data to enable Precision

medicine for example in the work we're
