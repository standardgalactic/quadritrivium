lean Alpha geometry is an AI system that

solves complex geometry problems and

were applied here to problem four for

example in that

competition remember move 37 for

alphao what I find Most Fascinating is

to hear how mathematicians leverage

these tools to wander into Uncharted

Territory and build new

intuition through vision language action

models robot are able to figure out how

to do things that they were never

explicitly programmed to do which was

impossible just a few years

ago if you were to see the video you

could see but I I hope you can p you can

picture um how robots can learn complex

two arm tasks from Human demonstrations

or

simulations and here's another example

that leverages gini 2.0 our most capable

and advanced model there's a lot of

potential to harness this for robotics

so we're experimenting with agents that

can help in the physical world by

applying by applying Gemini special

reasoning capabilities to robotics the

they have the potential to make

interacting with robotics much easier so

if you played the the game janga where

you have to remove those blocks of woods

um this is a video you can find online

but you you would see the robot doing it

very carefully and and the tower stays

put while they remove that that piece of

wood and a human comes in and destroys a

tower just to demonstrate that it wasn't

glued and it's actually a real Jena

Tower robotics is both a scientific and

an engineering discipline that's why

it's not focused on a keynote this

morning but it could be it really

deserves a lot of time and consideration

I encourage everyone to pay attention a

lot is going to happen in robotics in

the coming

years so in the same way that Alpha fold

has revolutionized biology we believe

that we're entering a new golden era of

Discovery where many scientific Fields
