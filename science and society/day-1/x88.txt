well yeah I I I like your comment about

uh over personized you know uh agents

you know I feel like our field are very

uh good at inventing or borrowing good

terms which are sometimes very confusing

terms agent you know has is a very

you know in philosophy in cognitive

science other places it kind of leads

you to think oh agent agency then

autonomy Free Will moral everything and

uh there is a kind of a slipper slope

nowadays for example you know a

automobile aircrafts they have proper

names so that we know that when they do

their job it is because they were told

to do that job and there's a steer or

it's being automated but uh for the

general public I think there is a great

deal of confusion right now about AI is

that really a intelligent creature

living in my computer or it is actually
