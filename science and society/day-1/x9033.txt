that's important to our customers and

then we can tailor to Enterprise use

cases and this is really where I going

to get to like sort of the content like

the message of Beyond open is good why

is open good and why is why why would we

want to especially focus on these kind

of smaller models with with good

capabilities tailored to to use case um

I want to direct you to that last uh

chart which is uh performance benchmarks

on real world cyber security benchmarks

and this is a place where we've put a

fair bit of work into granite and it

performs better both on public

benchmarks but also especially on our

that they produced because we put work

into it to tailor it and take the

expertise of our cyber Security Experts

and distill it into the models and I

open ecosystem where we have lots of

choice what that lets people do is it

lets experts and you know domain experts

to to take the models customize them

give the community a wider variety of

differentiated models for different

capabilities we're not saying we're

to you know our recipe for for um

Ratatouille might be different than

another restaurants recipe for patou and

we were we're catering to different

learning them uh and and you know

building up that that uh skill set but

you know it's not like the average

person who does cyber security or the

average person who does you know Supply

Chain management has those skills um and

when the answer to how we can do this

which I think is is sort of a maybe a

little bit of a provocation and an

invitation we would like to do this with
