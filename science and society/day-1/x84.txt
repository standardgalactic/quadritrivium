interesting thing that happened with

these agents is that the agent goes into

you know now they can take actions

arbitrary actions on web pages and

online sources so it found its way onto

the you know the search engine and the

New York Times side and then there was

just the popup that asked for the

password to be able to enter the New

York Times site so at that point you can

look into the reasoning patterns of

these agents and the agent saw a link

there for resetting the

password it doesn't know my passport

password but it it it can enter my email

address and it can uh go to my email

account it has those capabilities and

the agent just figured out a way of

resetting my password so those are the

boundaries that we are entering right

now in terms of a different a number of

different AI capabilities coming

together to power entities that are

taking actions in the world again just

to repeat we are talking about entities

that are taking actions using more

complex reasoning to come creative ways

of solving tasks and also being at a

stage right now in our community where

we haven't really Define the operational

boundaries of these systems so that's

why with any technology capability

that's evolving um er you made the

earlier point about like the work needs

to speed up especially around risks the

understanding and the work that that

really needs to speed up

maybe to build up on that um I think it

echoes also some of what we saw this

morning was the collective right like

with agents I think we see um how the

technology that we now have at our

disposal can be leveraged locally in a

decentralized way but at the same time

it raises the question you're asking and

you know the example you gave uh of the

security and the safety of those agents

I think it it it really brings up uh

cyber security to to a different level

if you think of um what Michael called
