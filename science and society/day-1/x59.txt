that some parts are consistently dark

blue likely representing well-defined

structures like

heles other segments for example Loops

show lower confidence suggesting that

these regions are more flexible and

harder to

prict and on the right you see a contact

map

which provides further

Insight it shows predicted interactions

between amino acids strong stronger

interactions mean closer

proximity the blue square highlights a

confident domain a region with lots of

strong

interactions matching the high

confidence of the

structure and the re red rectangle shows

a potentially disorder region the

interactions are weaker less frequent

reflecting the flexibility and

uncertainty of the structure there's

more wiggle room if you

wish so the key here is that the models

aren just giving structures they're

giving us a sense of how reliable the

structures are high confidence regions

are most more trustworthy and low low

confidence ones might need further

investigation this information is

crucial for researchers that allow them

to focus their efforts and interpret the

results more effectively

Alpha fold has now allowed us to map

over 200 million proteins that's pretty

much every protein known to

science so we then consulted with

experts in biocurity and ethics to

assess the risks and develop guidelines

for Alpha folds use it was released in

phases starting with a limited release

to researchers and gradually expanding

access while monitoring for potential

misuse we op sourced the alpha fold code

and created a database of protein

structure predictions that are enabling

researchers worldwide to use and build

upon the technology and you can actually

very easily use it if you search for
