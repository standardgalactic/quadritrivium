rules that a portfolio manager needs to

obey as to not make um well otherwise

you become uncompliant and the company

becomes extraordinarily liable so we

want to

automate this task you know this is a

business of hundreds of millions of

dollars of course we think that AI could

automate this task but the question is

how do we know that it did it

correctly

because if the AI actually encoded the

wrong set of rules or just made one

mistake this can have disastrous

consequences and likewise I think you

all have experience with interacting

with Chad GPT you might ask Chad GPT

some medical questions that will

actually decide

how you treat yourself whether you go

and see a doctor or not how do you know

that what is actually being passed on to

you is

correct so that's why you know some

people are actually questioning the

whole Enterprise which is that if we

need reliable systems in the end and

they depend on so many components that

are so so reliable how do we make sure

that the whole thing is

reliable so we've working on this I

think I should say that this is this

issue of what I want to call statistical

qu control has what basically fueled the

progress in manufacturing in the in

Japan for example in

1950s but I think what we're working on

is to say okay is it possible to assess

F data um so you know perhaps I have a

human actually score whether AI did

something correctly or not and is it

actually possible to score a task that

an AI did and so high score would be you

know 99% and that means informally that

99% of the time I say 99% the thing is

done correctly and so I'm not saying a

human should not look at it I'm saying

that you know maybe I can present two

three options to a human the human will

say yep that's a correct one and that
