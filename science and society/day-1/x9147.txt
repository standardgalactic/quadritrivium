happier I just again I want people in

the picture I don't want to I don't want

to take it with the joy that was the way

to take people out of the picture

precisely AI for science is very

exciting AI for mathematics is

fascinating because we are discovering a

lot of Terry tow will do even better

mathematics because there are amazing

things around science amazing things

excitement Yan your turn what do you

think of that optimism well certainly AI

for science uh and Medicine is uh very

exciting at the moment I don't

personally work on it directly but um

very favorable to uh my colleagues who

partake in this I mean there's a lot of

Hope indeed that we'll find solution to

you know Humanity's biggest biggest

problem with this um possibly climate

change with new materials uh for energy

storage or or things of that type some

of my colleagues at Fair actually are

working on it um so super exciting and

there's already a lot of uh progress

that have been deployed like in medical

imaging for example

um that said I think ultimately AI will

make people smarter um because all AI is

going to be

assistive the you know we talk about

autonomous Ai and things like that but

nobody is going to get an AI system that

does not assist them in some way and so

the incentives are there people are

working on this um it's not like you

know there's two types of AI like

completely autonomous that doesn't talk

to humans and then AI that is designed

to work with humans all of AI is

designed to work with humans but right

now the

problem of getting AI to interact

properly with human is number 354 in a

list of problems and we're still on

number five so um that's why people

aren't working on it because you know we

still have to solve like you know major

conceptual problems before we can get

there um but obviously Alli would be
