stage of the life cycle would help

exposed Alpha fold has helped

researchers understand the full length

structure of a critical protein related

to the disease and that breakthrough

marked a turning point in their work

enabling further research into a

transmission blocking vaccine to help

comit malaria what's important in all of

those examples is that Alpha fold is a

tool in the toolbox it's not enough but

it's critically accelerating a lot of

the

work now Alpha fold 3 has moved Beyond

proteins and can predict the structure

and the interactions of almost all of

life's

molecules you can think of Alpha 2 as

solving the static picture of a protein

and Alpha 3 is taking the first steps

towards modeling the interactions and

the Dynamics

it can model interactions between

proteins but also between proteins and

other

biomolecules so now that I've taken you

through a journey through the wonders of

biology I'd like to take a step back

because you might wonder why was a

company like Google deep mine interested

in protein folding in the first

place and what does it tell us about AI

assisted scientific discovery more

broadly

you might remember that Google Deep Mind

started by solving games we started with

Atari training AI only on the raw pixel

input with the goal of maximizing the

score just that dedicated goal and it

learned how to win on its

own and it wasn't just Atari it was

every

game our most notable game's

breakthrough was mastering the ancient

and complex game of Go arguably the

Pinnacle of games go is it incredibly

complex for a computer to solve because

it's very
