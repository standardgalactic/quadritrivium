might be interesting to play with they

might help stimulate you know uh

research but you can't use them to build

a business um there are other uh

licenses that add additional terms or

add complexities make it difficult to

sell through a product um so it's very

complicated and in the world of Open

Source software basically all of that

sort of complexity shook out pretty

early and basically just said okay we're

going to do MIT license BSD Apache 2

those are the licenses that are are

realistically what you want if you want

to advance open science um so why why do

you want this a couple reasons one is if

you wanted to customize your models you

need to be able to take it you need to

be able to do anything you want with it

um if it's tied to a proprietary

platform that's now technical

I can't swap it in swap it out as easily

for something else I can't take it to a

different uh you know uh you know cloud

provider um so you know this is

something that this is the reason why a

big part of why open source software was

so successful now we also think that

they need to be efficient and we don't

want to have them be narrow like we're

fine-tuning for individual tasks but on

the other hand we don't need necessarily

if you're building an HR chatbot or

you're building a supply chain assistant

you don't necessarily need a model that

knows Advanced physics it's just kind of

that took extra effort and extra

parameters to to be able to do it's just

really not something that's required and

you know we've been optimizing right now

on the on the the sort of small scale 8

billion parameters and Below where they

can fit on a single GPU they actually

run locally uh pretty well and we we

even have models that scale down to the

point where they work on mobile devices

and then for our next Generation models

we going all the way up to you know 100

billion parameters up and Beyond with

mixture of expert models and that kind
