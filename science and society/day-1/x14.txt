inference and connections and all that

is leading to such hypeen hysteria so I

think one of the reasons for that is

because we have some technology that's

developed but we also don't have a

really good vision of what to use it for

the Visions we have are the ones from

the

1950s we haven't updated the ones from

the 1950s that was McCarthy uh really

imitating the human How could a computer

intimate the human and there was

cybernetics how do we kind of imitate

animals who can you know do all these

amazing things climb through trees and

stuff like that that's it that's our

visions and now we're debating about the

implications for that are there business

models behind that and so on so forth

all right so on this slide I'm going to

propose something which is different and

that word collectivist hopefully will'll

Intrigue you what I mean by that let me

just say up front it kind of means

microeconomics and you know whenever we

hear all these fields that are involved

and all that we never hear the word

economics so I hope there's some

economists in the room because you guys

got stand up it's time to have a role

here that's what that's what's

missing okay so uh here's your standard

prehistory that you will see here's

here's how it all came about which is I

don't believe but I'm going to put it up

there anyway phrase AI was coined in

Dartmouth um 1956 they didn't really

know what they meant by intelligence so

they didn't Define it but it was

something that humans do all right Focus

was on an single intelligent entity be

that like a human-like entity or a

program but it was this one thing that

did this amazing stuff how do you do

that now I don't want to dismiss the

excitement of posing such a question and

the importance of posing it the

philosophical implications and so on but

it's not really what happened in

technology it's not the case that that
