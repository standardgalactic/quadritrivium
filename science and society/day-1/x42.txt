AI against human and that's how we

Define ai even though there isn't a

clear mathematically or even

quantifiable definition it's like put

two people or assistant and AI system

and people behind the screen and do

whatever you want to do in lingual

communication and the moment you cannot

tell in part you achieve AI I would say

that this is really a trap because uh

when we scientists and engineers build

systems very rarely we meant it for

beating a particular species you know or

achieving a certain state of the uh

reality we want to solve problems for

example if you build a car you build an

aircraft it will be very lame for you to

claim that my goal is to build human in

Runing or be the bird in flying right

you you actually want something more

functional and more measurable and that

basic already you know uh hopefully uh

encourage or motivates people to think

Beyond this touring test and in that

sense the target seems to be pointing to

what capacity and what utility you want

to build out of the system system and

also hopefully in that vein you can

rethink whether the system really is

heading toward having morality having

agency and having free will so that we

can be so scared to stop developing

that on the other side more than the

touring trap there's another trap I

found it's also more serious and

interesting which I call the K trap it

is related to how we build systems and

hway impant system you know over the

past 300 years of a civilization we

become almost religious and dogmatic

about

cism which basically highlights the

importance of reasoning above everything

right so we like first principle we like

Clarity and causality and we reach a

tremendous height in physics and many

other Sciences where we can just sit in

home and uh you know calculate a few

equations and we will predict you know

the position of celestal body so Force
