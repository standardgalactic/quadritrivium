but we are still very far from from

where we would like to be

okay so uh AI could be a game changer it

already started changing lots of thing

uh just take the example of alpha fold

which probably all of you have heard

about Nobel Prize uh last year in

chemistry in particular what Alpha fold

has soled is you know is one problem

which is useful you know going from uh

under biology to Dragon a market it's a

tiny piece of the process but still very

important but what's important is uh is

that if you look at the evolution of how

good we were at solving the problem that

Alpha f is solving meaning predicting

the 3D structure the 3D shape of a

protein from its sequence the domain was

plateauing for many years and then came

the technology Alpha One Alpha f 2 and

then many other you know similar models

were developed that suddenly changed the

field radically and in a sense you could

say that for this specific problem even

though we still don't have the equation

you know I cannot try the equation of

how to transform a sequence to a

structure we have a computational model

that's pretty good at it it's not

perfect you know we are not at 100%

accuracy but the field has changed so

much that today Alpha is used in all

pharmaceutical companies in all academic

Labs because it's useful it has solved

something so there's this notion that uh

maybe instead of looking for the

equations of biology this notion of

having

computational you know AI based

simulator of biology that could be for

proteins but that could be for other

things maybe a way to move forward and

so here we come to you know this this is

a the talk is not technical but what's

what's under you know under the hood of

of models like Alpha fold no surprise

it's a bit like an llm so I simplify a

bit you know but let's say that Alpha

fall and then the followup models

basically rely a lot on these Foundation
