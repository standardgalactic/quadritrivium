as thinking about thinking and that you

know in know uh Neuroscience or

cognitive scien is called metacognition

very very complicated word I will not re

pronounce it many times and so you know

the and then this is a knowledge about

somebody's own you know cognitive

process you know could be your own or

somebody else you know maybe you heard

you know things like theory of Mind well

now like you know having studied that in

uh cognitive Sciences how we can

actually use it with LM and how can we

can make llms working better and so you

know the cognitive Knowledge and Skills

are actually

processes whether they reply in a single

time right and so in this work we'll try

to see uh whether you know whether

already have like this works whether

already uh llms have this metacognitive

knowledge and can we extract this

knowledge from Ms and how can we use uh

you know to use LMS better and then

train lmm better right and so one of the

very easy example as as we are in poly

technique is like is mats right so in

mats you know we can think of we have a

catalog of skills you know that usually

we learn about during the high school

curriculum and you know we use them in

some order uh to solve a math problem

right so these are addition subtraction

and so on everybody understood what's

math hopefully uh and so you know over

the time you know the llm capabilities

have grown you know more and more and

more and you know you know and it's

becoming start uh you know being useful

for some core mathematical Concepts but

the question is can we actually extract

what concepts are being used you know

when we see the you know completion from

a prompt uh so one of the thing you know

we can ask right like humans can

verbalize what skills did you use in

this problem you know what did you you

know what kind of theory what kind of

equation you use you know to pull the

racket up as G Set uh you know uh so we
