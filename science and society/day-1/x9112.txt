for

fore okay

okay okay

okay I think we're going to have human

level intelligence before we have audio

video that actually

works okay um so if we have this world

model which is able to predict the

result of a sequence of

actions um we can feed it to an

objective which is a task objective that

measure to what extent the predicted

final State uh satisfies a goal that we

set for ourselves it's just a cost

function um and we also can set some uh

guardrail objectives think of them as

constraints that need to be satisfied

for the system to behave in a safe

manner right so those guard whs will be

explicitly implemented and the way the

system proceeds is by optimization it's

looking for an action sequence that

minimizes the task objective and the uh

guardwell objectives at runtime okay

we're not talking about learning here

we're just talking about inference

um and that will guarantee the safety of

the system because uh the guard rails

guarantee safety and there is no way you

can Jailbreak that system by giving it a

prompt that will you know have it Escape

its guardwell objectives the guard

objectives will be just

hardwired they might be trained but

hardwired now a sequence of actions

should probably use a single World model

that you repeat you use repeatedly over

multiple time steps okay so you have a

one model you Fe did the first action it

predicts the next St St and the second

action predicts the second next state

you can have guard cost and objective uh

task task objectives along the

trajectory the I'm not specifying what

optimization algorithm we can use it

doesn't really matter for the discussion

that we have um if the world happens not

to be completely deterministic and

predictable the world model may need to

have latent variables to account for all
