everything better just by scaling maybe

scientifically it's even more

interesting to to see how to get down to

smaller models but I think just as

important is to think about the

sustainability of our compute clusters

because currently everywhere in the

world people are building computer

clusters like crazy and uh and very

often they don't take into account what

kind of energy do you have in this place

and I think a great example how it

should be done is the the finished one

the the Lumi

cluster and they um I think if I

remember correctly they found some kind

of uh defunct empty Paper Factory

somewhere in the middle of

nowhere uh it was built next to Hydro

power so the power was there they just

filled the building uh with comput they

didn't even have to uh do new concrete

which also produces a lot of CO2 and I

think it's run 100% on sustainable

energy so the countries I think they

have to understand a cluster and and

maybe I think companies maybe already

see it like this but European countries

they sometimes consider a cluster a

Prestige project it's something where

you cut a ribbon and you get a picture

taken that appears in the newspaper and

then they put it in places that that are

somewhere where that don't really make

sense in terms of sustainable energy so

I think the fins did a good job they put

it in the middle of nowhere where nobody

wants to go but the energy is

sustainable okay so some progress but

but clearly a lot more uh to be done

let's stay with the idea of

sustainability Yan because you spoke

about you know uh systems being uh you

know not being quite where they should

be the fact that some systems have have

issues um what do you make of uh

sustainable IIA I AI rather development

goals and is there enough collaboration

around that in your view because we've

heard a lot about collaboration today
