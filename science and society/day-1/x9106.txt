Divergent every time you produce a token

there is some chance that the token is

not within the set of reasonable answers

and take you outside a set of reasonable

answers and if it does that there is no

way to fix it afterwards um and if there

is if you assume there is some

probability for that you know wrong

token uh for wrong tokens to be

generated and the errors are independent

which of course they're not um then you

get exponential Divergence uh which is

why you know we have with those models

hallucination

issues um but we're missing something

really big because uh you know never

mind trying to reproduce human

intelligence we can't even reproduce cat

intelligence or rat intelligence let

alone dog int

they can do amazing feats they

understand the physical world um you

know any house cat can plan very highly

complex um actions um and they have caal

models of of the world some of them know

how to open doors and and Taps and

things of that type um and in humans you

know a 10-year-old can clear up the

dinner table and fill up the dishwasher

without running zero shot the first time

you ask a 10-year-old to do it um yes

she will do it it 17-year-old can learn

to drive a car in 20 hours of practice

but we still don't have robots that can

act like a cat we don't have domestic

robots they can clear up the dinner

table and we don't have level five C

driving cars despite the fact that we

have hundreds of thousands if not

millions of hours of supervised training

data okay so that tells you we're

missing something really

big um yet we have systems that can pass

the bar exam do math problems prove

theorems

but no domestic robots so we keep

bumping into this Paradox called a Mor

Paradox right things that we take for

granted um because humans and animals

can do it we think it's not complicated
