also uh developed those methods and

applied them I should say to a number

number of uh Fields quite diverse fields

in fact of biomedical uh computational

photography and even astronomy uh

Bernard has also uh been a catalyst for

the mlss series of machine learning

summer schools in addition to that back

in 2023 he founded at the Ellis

Institute tubigan Bernard it be great to

have you up on stage welcome

[Music]

yeah thank thank you very much I am

happy very happy to be here it's I think

it's my second visit to the echal poly

Technic and the first one was uh I

remember I was picked up by a PhD

student um who is now uh so just this

helps you estimate how long ago this was

last time I saw him he was the director

of of Google brain in Zurich and in

Paris Olivia bu

so I guess now there's also a lot of

students in the audience uh so I'm

curious to see what will happen with you

in the next 20 years it's certainly an

exciting field to build your careers in

so I wish you all the best and good

judgment in all your endeavors so I'm

going to talk about causal

representations World models and digital

twins so I'm going to start with a

mainstream application of machine

learning but in a field that's dear to

my heart it's in a field of astronomy

gravitational wave inference

so this is uh about systems or systems

that we've trained to estimate the

poster distribution over physical

parameters of a system of black holes or

binary neutron stars that are circling

around each other and eventually

colliding to form a single more massive

black hole so just to so the way this is

being measured is that you have this

giant

interform each of these parts is several

kilometers long there's slide bouncing

back and forth and you measure interfer

effects and you measure slight
