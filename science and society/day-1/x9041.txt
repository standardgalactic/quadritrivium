we we have um we also you know have

efforts using llms to like read the

documents and find potential problems so

that's a huge Rich space that um that

sounds really boring honestly uh but you

know it it's what's needed to get the

world going and actually when you get

below the surface of the application

there's lots of interesting technology

there um even if like it's not like a

talking robot that you know vacuums my

floor or something it's like making sure

you're complying with the law you know

that that's kind of The Sweet Spot for

IBM okay thanks David

so we're going to move to our third

presentation by Karim bear CEO of inad

please Jo join me here

[Applause]

hopefully hopefully yeah it works okay

awesome awesome that's up perfect thanks

a lot hi everyone it's a pleasure to be

here so I'm kareim I'm the co-founder

and CEO of instad and uh many years ago

I was a student at the C poly Technic so

it's a really a special thing for me uh

to be to be here today it's it's really

a special thing for me like at Point car

after so many years and uh given that

this is the AI action Summit and that we

are discussing science I thought I would

give you a flavor of some of like the

cool work we've been doing at instad

Deep on the topic of foundation models

for genomics so rather than sort of like

demo or product or platform pitch really

like my goal here is to get you a sense

of sort of our scientific journey and

covering sort of like the capabilities

of AI models in the field of genomics

and this has been really like an

evolution we start

by uh training let's say uh classical

style models and then thinking about how

these could feed into multiple

modalities um thinking about how we

could push the State ofth art further uh

which which we did and finally like

getting you a sense of like some of the

interesting areas of research today and
