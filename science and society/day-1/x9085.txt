distortions of space time that are of

the order of a fraction of the diameter

of the nucleus of an atom it's

absolutely amazing amazing that this is

possible and then from these

measurements you try to estimate

properties of the system that generated

these gravitational waves such as the

masses the direction Sky position the

angular momentum

Etc so just to give you an idea how this

looks this is a video

uh how a nearby Observer would uh would

see such a merger of two black holes so

the black holes are black you don't see

that but you see how they distort the

the light that comes from from the

background and uh normally of course

this could go on according to Newtonian

Dynamics this could go on forever that

they circle around each other but

Einstein tells us they're losing energy

in the form of gravitational waves and

the first time such an event was

detected it was so loud in inverted

commas that we could have measured it no

matter where in the universe it had

occurred so I think this is fantastic

kind of thing so this is in this case

done with a normalizing a flow model and

with some physical knowledge built into

the system so that's great machine

learning the positive example but the

rest of the talk I will try to talk

about negative things and about

shortcomings of machine learning and

what we still have to improve and uh I'm

going to start with this example here

which is from medical image processing

so uh this was based on a system that

people train to detect what's called a

numo thorax so numo thorax means one of

your or one or both of the wings of your

lung

collapses and uh you can see it on an

X-ray and then the way so people trained

neural networks on many examples of Neal

thorax and normal lungs and got very

high my classification accuracy but

later when they tried to feel the system
