detection out of that and I feel like

the old internet is going to be like low

background steel for AI like we'll

treasure these old little pockets of

data that haven't been just sort of

regurgitated and remixed and rewashed um

I also think we're going to treasure the

data within companies right because that

data is actually sort of in many cases

that's the real data that's that's your

own data if you're if you're running a

business and that'll have a different

sort of um importance significance but

um but there is a definitely a sense

that like the the game might be over at

some point soon where like there just

won't be sources of public data anymore

that we can't be sure they aren't uh

generated but at the same time I feel

like the data game was already starting

starting to get over for language like

there's just less of a pressure to get

more and more data and more and more

sort of trying to get the right data um

but but certainly it's it's a it's an

interesting Trend the other thing too to

bring back the evaluation point is the

those evaluation data sets are all

littered around and some people don't

know it's there when they train some

people don't want to know it's there

when when they train and that's also

making everything very

complicated the so-called generated data

is simply data I think it's part of the

universe we have to live with I I I I

I'm not uh too uh concerned about uh uh

being overwhelmed or swimming in the

data like this because it's only going

to simulate

creativities from people to do something

even more fascinating imagine the

imagion of Photography you know it may

be making the the painters in the

feeling like uh there are too many

photographs here and uh you know I'm

going to swim in that but uh they figure

out to do something very different then

you know a new form of arts and the new

ways of generating contents and so forth
