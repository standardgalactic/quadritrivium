explanation why they're the same size so

if you've never seen the eving house

illusion the eving house illusion looks

like this so in this image the two

orange circles are actually the same

size so I thought this is fun and I

played around with multiple other

Illusions so maybe you know this one

this is a m illusion so here these two

lines are the same length this is I

think this is the pandorf illusion and

tner illusion so in this illusion so

this is actually a straight line here

all the lines are parallel but let's see

what happens if we go a bit more extreme

so here one here clearly this one is

shorter it still insists that the same

length we can even make it absurd and

ask it to assess these lines here it

still insists this is a variant of the M

illusion therefore they're actually the

same

length and uh same same works for this

illusion so here clearly this is not a

straight line uh it exists that it is

and it even offers to give a visual

explanation and the explanation is also

quite you feel you feel pity for the

model if you see that so this is the the

Top Model that we have currently uh

here's an extreme version of the Turnal

illusion where the lines are definitely

no longer parallel uh tp4 is convinced

they are parallel it also offers an

explanation here the explanation are

these straight lines

here so certainly so there are some

clearly there are some examples or there

some some correl between this image and

typical depictions of the T illusion and

these correlations they mislead these

models

clearly it's a lot of fun to play around

with these models so I I like to

whenever I give a talk I like to prompt

the model and ask it how it imagines the

scene so I can mentally prepare for the

lecture so here I said please generate

image of a plary talk and causal

representations World models and digital
