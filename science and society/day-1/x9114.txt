okay humans do this very well we're

completely incapable of doing this with

a systems today if you're starting a PhD

great topic might take more than three

years

um so I with all those Reflections about

three years ago I wrote a long paper

where I kind of explained sort of where

I think AI research should be focusing

on so this saw before the whole GP chat

GPT craze um I haven't changed my mind

about this CHT hasn't changed anything

we were working on LMS before that so we

knew what was coming anyway um this is

the paper um a path towards autonomous

machine intelligence that we now call

Advanced machine intelligence cuz

autonomous just scares people um and

it's on open review it's not on

archive and there's various versions of

this talk that I've given various ways

okay so very natural idea for getting

systems to understand how the world

works is um using the same process that

we used to

um to to train system for natural

language and apply this to let's say

video okay if a system is capable of

predicting what's going to happen in a

video you show it A short segment video

and you ask it to predict what's going

to happen next presumably it would have

understood the underlying structure of

the world um and so training it to make

that prediction might actually cause the

system to understand the annoing

structure of the

world it works for

text because predicting words is

relatively simple why is predicting

words simple because words um there's

only a finite number of possible words

certainly a finite number of possible

tokens and so we can't predict exactly

which word will follow another word or

what what word is missing in the text

but we can produce a probability

distribution or score for every possible

word in the dictionary we cannot do this

for images for video frames we do not
