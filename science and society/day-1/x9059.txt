start seeing different types of cells

subtypes of cells if you study cancer

you see the cells become a bit crazy so

you start having a quantitative way to

describe cells their their trajectories

Etc um and so that domain is moving very

quickly something interesting is that

you know the community working on that

is I would say super small compared to

llms for text or even computer vision

and so I would say that so far the

technology more or less is about just

taking existing models

GPT and then you have a cell you say how

can I transform a cell into a text and

then train a text model like GPT and you

get something name single cell GPT okay

there's been a few more models but I

would say that there is massive

opportunities to be better than that

because obviously there's no reason why

transforming you know what you measure

in a Cell the best you can into a text

and then using a an standard llm would

be the best way to

do okay but this being said you know the

kind of direction we're going to and

there's been position papers uh very

recently published in cells you know the

big Journal saying that once we have

that what can we do you know the H is

that once you have a computational model

of a cell so you have one cell you can

do genomics on it so you measure DNA RNA

protein epigenomics Etc then you can map

it to a you know numbers so

computational representation of a cell

and then the kind of things you can do

is typically predict other properties of

a cell or predict and this is an immense

challenge as well predict the the

response of a cell to perturbations

right so we need also to have a notion

of causal AI here where we'd like to

have a representation and a way to

simulate what happens to a cell if you

for example treat the cell with an

existing or candidate drug so that

little by L we can get to this

computational approach to have rational
