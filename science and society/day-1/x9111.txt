planning uh so a system would look like

this um you you get observation from the

world you go through a perception module

that produces an estimate about the

state of the world but of course the

state of the world is not completely

observ so you may have to combine this

with a memory the content of a memory

that con you know contains your idea of

the state of the world you don't

currently

perceive um and the combination of those

two goes into a world model so what is a

world model World model is given a

current estimate of the state of the

world which is in an abstract

representation space and given an action

sequence that you imagine

taking uh your word model predicts the

the resulting state of the world that

will um occur after you take that

sequence of actions okay that's what the

world model is if I tell you imagine a

cube floating in the air in front of you

okay and I rotate this Cube by 90 de

around the vertical

axis um what does it look like it's very

easy for you to kind of have this metal

model of a cube rotating

um okay

okay

okay okay

hopefully all

right let's hope this will be more

stable okay

um 50 HZ not 60

HZ okay so uh what you can do now

is uh feed okay hang

on I'm make a more radical Choice here

okay this doesn't look like it was a

good

idea oh I know why

I that's nice

me

okay I don't have an external screen

anymore

get out get

out what

for okay

okay Z
