with tens of thousands of gpus like

there's nothing you can bring to the

table do something else um there's a

number of problems to solve U training

those things with you know large scale

data blah blah blah planning algorithms

are kind of inefficient we have to come

up with better methods so if you are

like into optimization applied math it's

great um J Will relent variables

planning under uncertainty hierarchical

planning which is completely unsolved um

learning cost module because probably

most of them you can't build by hand you

need to Lear them and then there is

issues of exploration Etc okay so in the

future we'll have Universal virtual

assistants they'll be with us at all

times they will mediate all our

interaction with the digital world we

cannot afford to have those systems come

from a handful of companies from the

west coast of the US or China uh which

means the platforms on top of which we

build those systems need to be open

source and widely available they are

expensive to train but once you have a

foundation model fun tuning it for a

particular application is relatively

cheap and a lot of people can afford to

do this so the platforms need to be

shared they need to speak all the the

world languages understand all the

world's cultures all the value systems

all the centers of Interest no single

entity in the world can train a

foundation model of this type this

probably will have to be done in a

collaborative fashion or distributed

fashion again some work for Applied

mathematicians who are interested in

distributed algorithms for large scale

optimization um and so open source AI

platforms are necessary the danger I see

um in Europe and in other places is that

uh geopolitical rivalry will U entice

governments to basically make the

release of Open Source model illegal

because they're under the impression

that a country will stay ahead if he
