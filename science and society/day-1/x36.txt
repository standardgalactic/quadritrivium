uh more of your kind of personal view on

AI a little bit later in our fireside

chat Yan luk you'll have a chance you'll

be able to respond to some of those

provocative comments on Facebook from

Mike there um that keynot address then

takes us quite nicely into the first

plenaries of the day and perhaps one of

the first difficult decisions that uh uh

many of you are going to have to to make

we're going to have plenaries taking

place simultaneously so uh in the arago

ampi which is at just below our ampat

you'll have the opportunity to listen to

to the statian that uh uh Mike just made

reference to you'll be listening to

Emmanuel Condes who is the baram Simons

chair in uh mathematics and statistics

at uh Stanford

University uh after Emmanuel you can

also hear from asuman o oad who is a

mathwork professor of electrical

engineering um and uh at the College of

computing MIT uh I can see lots of you

making your way there good you've

revised uh the program that talk with uh

Emanuel KZ and of course asuman Ogar

will take place in the arago

amphitheater here in the pan

Amphitheater we'll be welcoming uh

Professor Eric Shing to the stage and

Eric is president of the Muhammad bin

Zed University of artificial

intelligence that is the first uh

artificial intelligence University uh in

the world um he's also professor of

computer science at the carnegi melon

University and co-founder and chief

scientist at the Gen uh bio AI so what I

propose we do is give a few of you just

a couple of minutes to choose which uh

amphi theater you're going to be uh in

what either here in the panker OR also

in the arago and we will start our first

plenary here in the p with uh Eric Shing
