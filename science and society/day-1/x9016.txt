look into speech as a as a way of of

communicating first of all in terms of

the the

speech on oral expression is something

which is very natural and it's it's

certainly even way more accessible to

most of the of the of of the people

compared to reading and writing so it's

a it's a very inclusive and also there

you can carry expressiveness and and

emotion there so it's it's very rich

channel of expression and when it comes

to communicating it allows when it did

to convey a lot of of information very

efficiently and also in the uh while

being Lively when people talk they can

they can interrupt each other Etc

sometimes a bit too much but it's part

of the communication and it makes the

interaction between people and hopefully

one day between human and machines uh

fairly natural and and practical um when

you look at the uh the technology angle

to these uh questions of of speech and

and voice technology there are different

use cases one is spoken dialogue which

will be the main focus of the

presentation but there are all other

tasks which are related one is

transcription of the speech one is the

generation of speech and the last one is

translation but there are other uh other

tasks that you might think of uh and

when it comes little illustration when

it comes to voice interaction with

machines you might remember this Al

9,000 in space ody 2001 Space Odyssey

although it didn't go too well in the

movie but the uh the the voice

technology is pretty good um okay so

it's very important to try and and and

get this naturalness in the interaction

with machines through uh speech uh but

it's fairly difficult and my slides are

completely broken now I'm sorry to

discover that on the spot uh so but here

it goes um it wasn't meant this way the

the the the the the writing so anyway

one of the difficulties that the current

um the the current system works usually
