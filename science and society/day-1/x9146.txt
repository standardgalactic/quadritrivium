agenda okay Mike yeah I was never an AI

person because to me AI was the

Frankenstein we're trying to build this

thing that looks like us and we have

enough of us I just I want us to

interact better with each other um so

you know yes I think I have this human

complimentary AI and the new ways of you

know making new kinds of music together

you know and doing things together and I

have a lot of kind of positivity about

that but this this human race is also

extremely conflictual we just bicker

over resources to you know and and and

we can't just multiply resources so

economics also teaches us how to talk

about scarcity and a lot of the Silicon

Valley problem that I that I I'm not

optimistic about is I don't think they

get that I don't think they get that

they can't just blow away scarcity

because they can just create as much

stuff as you need and that's not what

happens in the real world there's not as

much stuff you need if you got a lot of

stuff I get less stuff you got to find

ways to have people be happy with that

and to trade and to interact and I think

our world's gone backwards in in a in

this period I don't know if AI is going

to help but I am optimistic that if

people think about it in the right way

it can try to be more transparent allow

more communication uh bring down the

temperature of all the conflict that I

still think see very dangerous for our

world that we're in right now you're

advocating essentially human

complimentarity to to make some strides

towards that Mike yeah even just like

the before large language model just

translation systems they're they're

pretty good and um so maybe you so I

can't speak Mand I can't speak manderin

but I can speak into this microphone in

French um I'm pretty good in French by

the way step for and outcomes outcomes

um out comes Mandarin and I can Comm

Comm to other to other people but AI for

the right for science that makes us
