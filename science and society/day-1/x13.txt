of the key questions that we'll be

looking at notably at France's role and

The Wider European role uh in uh AI uh

can I ask uh both Laura tieri as well as

our chair people for this event Eric and

uh Mike to come up on stage for family

photo good way to start

off yeah family FOC

Mike probably best to stay up here

probably best to stay out here yeah

okay thank you very much for that uh

family uh photo uh our next speaker uh

many of you will say doesn't necessarily

need uh a big uh introduction uh Mike

Jordan is an internationally uh renowned

scientist uh in uh the field of uh not

just artificial intelligence but also uh

computational uh computer science sorry

and statistics um many of you know Mike

as a professor at uh Berkeley University

uh you're also I understand helping out

at the inra with their kind of new uh

Dynamic uh program uh called markets and

machine learning if I understand

correctly you'll be chairing that for

the next 5 years uh Mike uh back in 2016

Mike was named uh the world's most

influential computer science by the very

prestigious Journal uh science the

accolades uh go on and on uh Mike and

perhaps I won't uh spend as much time on

that what what I find really uh

impressive is the number of PhD students

over the years that you have uh

supervised students who have gone on

themselves uh to make waves in uh the

world AI uh Mark Jordan great to have

you with us and I'll hand it over to you

[Applause]

all right it's a pleasure to be here and

to kick this off I hope I will have some

slides good I don't think there's ever

been an era in human history where a new

field of technology has arisen where

there was so much hype and hysteria

around

it I think maybe electrical engineering

came close electrons were going to set

fire to the world and all it's amazing

to me that we you know data and
