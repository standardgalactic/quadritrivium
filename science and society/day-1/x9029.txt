positioning is you know basically

there's a bunch of pain points that that

model development has today and then

collectively as a field we need to you

know we need to figure those out and

this is something that we're working on

at IBM and others are working out at

other companies that are operating in

the space but the models need to be

trusted they need to we would argue be

open we think that that transparency is

really important at every level of of

its usage we'll talk more about that

they need to be performant they need to

do what you need them to do that's

that's really important that's

non-negotiable we would argue they need

to be customizable and we'll talk more

about that uh in a minute they should be

efficient to to address this um issue of

climate change but also cost and ideally

they should be flexible we don't want to

give up the general purpose swis army

knife nature of these models um so uh so

I'm I'm going to tell you a little bit

about what we're doing at IBM uh to

build models so we we entered on into

this uh you know on to this stage

relatively recently uh with our IBM

Granite models and this isn't a sales

pitch they're actually free you can just

go get them on hugging face um but the

idea here what we wanted to emphasize is

you know these are open and there's an

interesting Trend in the field today

where uh what it means to be open varies

um so are the models open weights is it

an open recipe that you could actually

reproduce is the data available do you

even know what the data is if you wanted

to go collect it yourself and then

there's a whole other dimension of about

the commercial usage rights of different

open source models so some models uh so

we release our models under an Apache 2

license that's sort of the de facto you

can do anything with this you want

including commercial applications but

there are other models that are only

available for research purposes so they
