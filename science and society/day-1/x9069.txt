SPM like something that I started also

working on as inspired but I'll I'll do

my best I'm and I work on in a stealth

startup we try to uh build new

generation of models and why I cannot

tell you on extent uh what we're doing

I'll tell you about our L NS paper and a

current submission uh some of those

Sparks uh Inspire what we're doing now

and so this is a work with Anette from

Milas superise by anirut from meta and

Yoshua uh Rosemary from Deep mine uh

Shuan from from Cambridge Tim from Deep

M Daniel as well Mike Moser uh from

brain and deep mind and U sanjiv who

developed a new theory of skills during

sabatica also with anirut and uh this is

one of the one of the followup of this

work and so teror of the skills is

something that uh that you know helps us

to understand uh you know why or how llm

could emerge uh skills it's a very very

good theoretical paper but like now now

we'll start to be very very practical uh

so let's uh let's get to it so you know

they say that like humans are different

because we are thinking but I would say

like there is even more of it you know

we're more than just thinking we are

also capable of thinking about thinking

uh and that's the title of my talk and I

see this also as a like somehow

progression potentially uh without the

limit right so like there is this thing

oh when when will we hit the wall well

do we have AGI and so on you know but it

for me I see this very differently as a

it reminds me of the Hilbert's program

right when he tried to to classify

mathematics in the first aium theorm and

then he tried to prove you know you know

zero logic uh that zero complete in the

first order first order in second order

well until until God will find out this

is not not possible try to prove there

is a God and didn't end up very well uh

but you know I think we are at the at

the point when we can not only have L&M

you know thinkings you know I with a lot

of quot uh but we also can do something
