biological data from DNA to RNA to

protein to cell to tissue and to

phenotype why this is possible well

because we see similar thing are

happening already you know in our

cognitive space with language model

merged with a visual model not with you

know uh uh Audio models and so Force so

multimodality is no longer a hurdle the

fun part is of course is to find the

right right representation architecture

for Unique biological data that is

different from a human language and

visual but this is a ongoing research

which I believe to be very very

rewarding and interesting and uh our

approach is to take a divid approach to

build smaller models from ground up and

then try to really connect them together

through for example hierarchical

embedding through cascading of

information

and the conditional generation and so

for they have all sorts of techniques

being developed and to be developed to

make use of the models in a collective

way and then you can harmonize them

hopefully to achieve Higher prodi Goals

which can simultaneously for example

predict you know interesting queries you

know from all different levels all the

way from drug design to you know

simulation of cellular environment and

the treatment

effects I think this vision is is uh

going to be disrupting the science of

biology in a tremendous way right now

you know uh the field of biology are

still primarily relying on wlab physical

experiments and trial to make the

discovery to confirm the discovery which

is a very expensive thing and uh with

imagine a digital organism which can

simulate all possibilities of biological

word what you will probably do is to use

the simulator the AI system to First do

the exploration

right to weight off the low hypothesis

uh low probable hypothesis and the only

you know uh output the most probable
