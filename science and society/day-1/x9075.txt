what is the skill this is the question

what is the skill uh do we just ask llm

this and then we just cluster them based

on uh you know based on similarity and

for that we also ask llm you know we

could just you know forget of old

clustering methods you know so maybe

you're understanding a radius of of

triangle and understanding the you know

other geom GE geometric properties are

are similar so these are really the

examples of cluster that we get actually

so like the mega cluster we call Circle

geometry and these are the these are the

subclusters and just to REM time did we

did it completely automatically you know

so we nobody was labeling clusters and

and merging them together so Ira

calculation techniques you know in

polygon geometric circles and so on and

then we just relabel those skills in our

category of skills with these Mega skill

meta skills or aggregating skills such

that such that we have you know more

examples for these particular skills

also well and then at the inference time

we just retrieve based on that so we you

know we get a new question with a test

question we ask our llm you know what is

this skill what would skill you would

apply in this question you know it's

somehow like the teacher calls you to

board and say well here's the question

what would you use in this question and

and and this is you know like uh the

reason why you know this actually works

it's like is that that we still still

all as a community still didn't find

like how do we retrieve information in

the best way in from llms you know so

you know at at the beginning you know

like you know few years ago you know

when I started work with like RF for

Sparrow like old deep my model you know

we we we use like you know all these

company scale search or French company

called killi you know on to uh to label

those things and and we started because

parro was supposed to be the model that

was you know safer well we also want it
