given observational data to test what

kind of CA structure might be compatible

with the data now if we do this with

conditional Independence testing

conditional Independence testing is a is

a tary concept so conditional

Independence requires three variables so

if we had a system with only two

variables we wouldn't be able to

distinguish what is cause and what is

effect but uh but this classical

approach uh only looks about the top

into the topological aspects of the

information how it propagates but in

addition to that we also have these

mechanisms on the nodes these

conditionals over there we're given its

parents and uh as these noises or the

information spreads through these notes

spreads through the mechanisms it also

picks up a footprint of those mechanisms

and that needs additional assumptions

and and we've shown that some of these

can help even in cases that are not

solvable

traditionally and one assumption that

we've thought a lot about and are still

thinking about is uh we call the

independent causal mechanisms assumption

and I want to show it with this example

it's yet another visual illusion if you

want uh so this is a so-called sh

chair you can see it's not a chair but

if you look through this hole

here then uh so look through this thing

then it looks like a chair so that means

if you look through this hole then

perception fails perception doesn't work

you see something which isn't there

perception fails because this assumption

is violated the Assumption says that the

causal generative process is composed of

autonomous modules that do not inform or

influence each other that means in

particular uh so this this structure

let's think of this as the world should

be and with should be independent of the

perceptual process so the conditional or

this mechanism that gives us the percept

given this state of the world and we
