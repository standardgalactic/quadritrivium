maybe uh just tell you two more

desiderata that I think are interesting

for Cal

representations um first one uh you

could call hom homomorphism maybe the

first example of this was Li nits he

once said that suppose that the concept

of a living being is represented by the

number three and the concept of being

rational so in doubt with reason is

represented by three so two and three

then a human should be represented by

six so the product of two and three so

that's a homomorphism in the sense that

or if you believe uh so in since that

there's a structure in one domain so

here's the logical relationship so being

living and rational so and is a logical

relationship are preserved in another

domain with a different

operation and uh and the second one you

could call consistency and I'm sure many

people thought about this one of them

was uh hats and he said we create

internal symbols of external objects in

such a way that the images consequences

that are necessary in thought coincide

with the images of the consequences that

are necessary in nature so something

happens in nature and our

representations are such that whatever

sort of we think is happening in thought

is consistent with that so that means

there's a there's a commutative diagram

so we have something in the world

there's an operation in the world leads

to a new state our representation f is

such that if we uh carry out the

representation of the action so the

consequences that are necessary in

thought then we end up in the same place

as if we go this way and I think that's

uh um that should be the core of what's

a causal representation and we have a

bunch of papers about this we also have

some work about uh the homomorphism idea

so if you have actions in the world

interventions that for instance have a

group structure then you would like uh

this to be a group representation so
