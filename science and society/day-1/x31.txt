at vast cost millions and million tens

of millions of Euros or dollars for all

these therapeutic areas clinical trial

is that I go get like you know 15,000

people and give them the drug and 15,000

people don't get the drug and I do it

randomly and then I compare and see if

the drug Works cost a lot of money to do

those kind of things if you don't do the

clinical trial you're going to do bad

science and Do Bad

Medicine all right so we think about

this this is not the way the FDA thinks

about this FDA is the American

regulatory agency we think of this as a

principal agent problem the FDA is a

principal that only has partial n

knowledge here's a new drug being

proposed I can look at that protein and

say well that maybe that'll act on this

kind of you know uh cell maybe that'll

help I can I can guess but I don't know

very much and I'd like to decide whether

it goes to Market or not so I have to do

a clinical trial if I if I'm the FDA all

right and what's the FD trying to do

well they're trying to be a good

statistician they want to control

statistical errors false FSE want

positives and false negatives false

positive is I put a bad drug on the

market that's that would be bad false

negatives I failed to put a good drug on

the market that would be bad FDA is very

good at trying to control those errors

they're

statisticians but the problem is that

the proposed hypotheses they're getting

the here's a good protein to look at is

not just coming out of nature or out of

science it's coming from self-interested

Agents which are the pharmaceutical

companies right and the pharmaceutical

companies know things about whether the

protein is likely to work or not that

they don't tell the

FDA all right so now if the

pharmaceutical company knows the FDA is

using some statistical procedure to

control errors it can game the system it
