strange going on in that window so you

you take a you take a video and you take

the 16 video Frame Window you slide it

over the video and you measure the

prediction error of the system and if

something really strange happen like an

object spontaneously disappears or

change

shape um the prediction error shoots up

so what it tells you is that that system

despite its Simplicity has learned some

level of common sense it can tell you if

something really strange in the world is

happening um lots of experiments to show

this in s various contexts for various

types of intuitive physics but I'm not

going to I'm going to skip to this uh

latest work uh D Dino World model um so

this is using Dino features and then

training a predictor on top of it which

is action condition so that it's World

model that we can use for

planning um and this is a a paper that

is on archive there's a website also

that you can uh you can look at the URL

is at the top

here so basically train a predictor

using you know a picture of the world

that you run through a dino

encoder and then an action that maybe a

robot um takes so you get the next frame

uh of that of that video next image from

the world run this to the D encoder and

then train your predictor to just

predict what's going to happen given the

action that was taken okay very simple

to do

planning um You observe an initial state

run into the doo encoder then run your

world model multiple time steps with

imagined actions um then you have a

Target state which is represented by a

Target image for example you run into

the encoder and then you compute the

distance in state space between the

predicted State and the the the State

representing the the target

image and the planning consists in just

through optimization finding a sequence

of actions that minimizes that cost at
