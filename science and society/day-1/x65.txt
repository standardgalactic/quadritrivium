known as hurricanes or

typhoons it's really helpful to get

better and more advanced warnings of

where they'll strike and when they will

strike the land so weather neck delivers

Superior predictions of the tracks for

those

storms initially it's an emble forecast

so it shows a wide range of possible

paths for the typhoon here at typhoon

ajus seven days in

advance and you see that the spread of

the predicted path tightens over several

days into a high confidence accurate

cluster as they approach the coast of

Japan nuclear fusion and Eric also

alluded to it um fusion power is the

Holy Grail of energy it's clean

essentially unlimited energy but one of

the main many enormous technical

challenges is to control the plasma

inside the reactors need to think of it

as hotter than the Sun so you really

want to avoid for the plasma to touch

the walls of the

reactor we've partnered with the Swiss

plasma center which has an experimental

reactor in loan to successfully develop

and use reinforcement learning to

control the plasma inside the reactor by

adjusting the voltage through the

magnetic coils 10,000 times per second

and we've been able to use this system

to reshape the plasma into different

shapes including some that had been

completely missed by traditional ways to

see how we can optimize the fusion

process so I could not give a talk here

attical poly technique and not include a

slide or two on

math we're leveraging AI to solve

mathematical problems and we tested them

against some of the mathematical Olympia

problems last summer at the IMO

2024 Alpha proof has demonstrated

capabilities that are approaching gold

medal level at the olympiads it's a

system that trains itself to prove

mathematical statements in the formal

language
