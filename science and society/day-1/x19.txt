people uh where is the uncertainty it

also has to do with Providence did that

data point come from yesterday or last

year or 10 years ago if it came from 10

years ago there should be more

uncertainty uh from the timing of the

day there's all kinds of issues and

uncertainty um there will be a talk a

plenary by Emanuel candes later this

morning uh he is like me a statistician

very interested in an uncertainty and

I'd encourage you to attend that talk um

now I would argue that individual humans

are not so good at coping with

uncertainty just by themselves you put

us on a desert island you know we kind

of make a mess of things but when you

put us in

collectives right we're really good so

if I don't know how long it takes to get

from here to inria which is on

rubo um I can ask uh let's see Eric

Molen he knows he used to work there so

I ask him and I get a good estimate we

do this all the time among each other we

don't know something we ask somebody

they give us an answer we can tell by

the way they answer the question how

sure they are we infer things we build

cultures that mitigate

uncertainty it's one of the things we do

really really well so that we can start

to build and plan and and feel

good all right so collectives are really

important now collectives also provide

context by what we mean by uncertainty

here's a duck who is a

statistician the duck has gotten a very

good estimate that on the left side of

this Lake there's a certain amount of

food to be had on average you know that

amount of food and on the right maybe a

little

less okay uh and the duck has got nice

Quantified conformal prediction error

bars on this and then you know duck is

kind of ready to make a decision now so

should the duck go to the left side of

the lake today or to the right side of

the lake all right well the optimal
