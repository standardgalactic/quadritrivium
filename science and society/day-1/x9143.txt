ensure that bias doesn't necessarily

have like huge negative effects with

optimization rather than

bias yeah M objective optimization sorry

is diversity okay if you have open

source platforms you will have a wide

diversity of AI systems with different

opinions different value system

um different biases political or

whatever they are and then people have a

choice it's like the Press we need a

high diversity in assistant for the same

reason we need to diverse you are right

but as you know there is rather a

monopoly

situation there would be a monopoly

situation it's not there be Monopoly

sitation are in a monopoly situation if

there is uh if the proprietary systems

win and we can only get AI assistance

from a handful of companies from China

way go to the US yes there would be it's

also how these systems are structured

humans evolved to be in Clans in groups

of 5 to 10 to 20 to 200 to build

democracies to build trust and all that

suddenly we develop technology where

everybody's listening to that one famous

person and that that's a completely

that's an experiment that's been done on

the human race in the last 20 years and

I don't think it's been does someone

agree or a semi agree

I don't think that I mean the jury may

be out but um it has generated some

massive disruption to human society and

and it's it's you could have imagined a

different model for these networks where

there's a sphere in which you know

children exist and they there it's for

children and it's it's where children go

and where spheres where others exist

instead no everyone listens to Donald

Trump and and or or Beyonce and and so

we're doing this massive social

experiment um and saying our technology

Will Will just solve it and I I think

that

we're we're not I don't know where the

inflection Point's going to come but
