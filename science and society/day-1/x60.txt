alphafold Server you can type your own

favorite amino acid sequence and get a

beautiful protein so I encourage you all

to just try

it it's now been leveraged by more than

two million scientists worldwide and

it's become a standard tool in the

biology

toolkit I'd like to share a couple of

examples

we all know that plastic pollution is a

threat to the

environment alphafold has helped

researchers to make breakthroughs that

could help solve this problem a

particular team in the UK was able to

screen 100 CED enzymes in two days

supporting their work to potentially

engineer faster more stable cheaper

plastic recycling

enzymes in the race against drug

resistance bacteria bacteria have

evolved the ability to defeat modern

antibiotics and that's quickly becoming

a global

problem with new antibiotics thin on the

ground scientists are looking for a

different approach can we actually

Target the resistance mechanism of

bacteria blocking the mechanisms which

is controlled by enzymes should allow

existing antibiotics to continue to

function but understanding the structure

of these enzymes have proven incredibly

challenging with purely experimental

methods so alphaa has helped researchers

reveal structures within the resistance

mechanism this is accelerating their

work on possible solutions to that

problem of antimicrobal

resistance one last

example as you might know malaria is

second only to TB tuberculosis in terms

of its devastating Global impact it

killed roughly 600,000 people in 2020

mostly children under the age of five

and existing vaccines only target the

first stage of the parasites life life

and that has limited

efficacy so vaccine effective at every
