models to do rag search uh Vector

searches of content it'd be great if

those embedding models were designed to

work with the model you're working with

which is the case of what we're doing

with granite and you know it's a whole

Suite of tools it takes a sort of a

village of models to be able to do

things so I'm I'm going to step in just

a little bit on what these are so we

have uh 3.1 series came out uh you know

a couple months ago we're having 3.2

coming out uh next month and these are

just sort of standard state-of-the-art

models so the main conjecture here I'm

going to make is that all of that

transparency and being open about the

data and being very careful about the

legal clearances of the data and all of

that doesn't necessar doesn't need to

com compromise quality it's we've at

various points have heard like oh only a

social media company can do this because

they have social media data and that

somehow is getting in the model and

that's how they're doing it or oh you

need to break these rules if you want to

do this it it turns out it's not true

like across a wide range of benchmarks

you know some cases were a little bit

better some cases we a little bit worse

but you know we're we're we can produce

a model in a way that's completely

transparent completely open that's

that's toe-to-toe with with a wide range

of models uh and we can do that while

being you know highly transparent so

this is a transparency index from

Stanford uh this was actually uh for a

previous generation that wasn't even

open source so we're hoping our numbers

will be bigger next year um but it it

just fits into this trend of you know

lots of open things being available we

think that level of choice is great and

then we can focus on the things that are

important for us so we can you know make

sure that um the mo the models are safe

you know we can score highly on a

variety of different safety benchmarks
