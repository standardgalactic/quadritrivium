clinical trial things like that so

nothing wrong with regulating

applications

where I think there was very contentious

discussions um in the past is that some

people think AI is intrinsically

dangerous even if you don't deploy it

and made attempts to convince

governments people in governments to

regulate research and development and I

think that's extremely dangerous

extremely destructive in fact it's

basically medieval obscurantism let's

put it this way okay um and and it's

very dangerous for the reason I

explained earlier which is that if you

keep AI technology under lock and key

you're going to get regulatory capture

by just a handful of companies all in

the US and in China um so we need open

source models if you have any kind of

Regulation that uh puts the

responsibility of someone doing

something bad with your open source

model on the originator of the

technology you're not going to have open

source I mean you made an interesting

point there if we go above and beyond

the kind of danger or of you know too

much regulation not enough we've spoken

today about dangers outside of that

people concerned that ultimately uh you

know algorithms are going to be biased

uh that they're not going to have you

know enough data protection how do we

remedy that and how do we reassure

people that you know as you started out

saying AA is not something to be feared

right from the outset there was a great

talk by Emanuel candes today on

bias um so you take your black box it'll

always have bias especially for things

that are on the edge of knowledge that

it doesn't have much information about

so that's why you got to be at a

statistician too you got to say look I

don't know enough to give you the answer

here or is probably likely it it needs

to be corrected or you should get a

little bit of gold standard data to add
