digit number and questions you can you

know almost you could believe it

generalized uh with the four digigit

numbers and this demonstrated you know

how to solve a related problem but the

thing is that sometimes you know the

related problem is not something that

you would retrieve you know with your

embedding uh that you found you know and

so models you know another thing is just

providing reasoning chain right so you

can actually you know with a standard

prompting you know Roger has five tennis

balls and so on the answer is 11 and

cafeteria has 23 apples and for 27 all

this was not so good and when you have

chain of term probing you try to explain

you know your thought of process you

know often time you you get better

answers because you know the things that

they use is also describe how you use

them you know so this is a why had Roger

11 balls or whoever uh you now because

it started with five five plus six and

you know now llm was able to you know

get to the right right solution well but

there is a problem with Chain of Thought

right know and this is example like

compute sign of two 210 and you know we

get one example second example and we

find some and third example is not even

very related you know just a different

way of thinking is that like imagine

that you do something uh something uh uh

in biology right and you have to solve

some you know uh uh you

know physical equation right or some

something because you like you know the

G show this F equal m&a and you try to

do a retrieval with a chain of thought

and since your everything what you have

is in biology your closest retrieval

things often you know very much

influenced by the embeddings of the

words will be from biology but maybe

actually answer for the question looking

because you're you know you're looking

you're working and you're trying to

discover new think as GP will actually

are not in biology maybe you would you
