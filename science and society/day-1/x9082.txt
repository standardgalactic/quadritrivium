computation using Game Theory but this

is for me all thank you very much yeah

thank

you thank you Michelle well we'll have

time for just one question before

that yeah

here yeah thank you so what you sorry so

what you were doing uh with the llm is

clustering uh

example so that you can use laters so my

question is why uh do you need uh to

Cluster them as skills which seem to be

um uh like limit maybe the Clusters

because you need to represent them in

the in a language that we understand

yeah uh in contrast if you have like uh

if you clustering in maybe the space of

embeddings you can like contain clusters

that cannot be expressed in terms of uh

of skills yeah yeah excellent question

and I add even one other question that

you could have point out too because you

know you also asking llm and maybe

strong LM that you had to train first uh

to get it and also you have to you know

pay the cost for the inference right and

so you could even you know do something

as you said and so you know you remember

the real reason and you know so one of

the reason is like we wanted to just

focus on having the skills and uh this

was the time that you know Sanji uh rece

open the Princeton Language Institute

and receive 8 million do for GPT for

credit very good for school you know

let's see if this what happen here uh

not GPT Credit mral Credit uh and um and

uh and so this this was a run so we

didn't Focus that but like this is

actually stuff that we're doing right

now you know we're replacing embeddings

because like you know if you want to

like push the ad in more you could even

see like which data sets are the most

relevant to train for my final task

right and so and that's what you don't

want to First you there is no name for

this aming right so you know uh M and

Ben in B work on something like like lat

D allocation right like some some
