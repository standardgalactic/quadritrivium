through an encoder and perhaps to a

predictor or decoder and you make a

prediction for why okay that street

forward

prediction and then on the right this

jeta architecture you run both X and Y2

and coders which may be identical or

different and then you predict the

representation of Y from the

representation of X in this abstract

space what this will cause the system to

basically learn an encoder that

eliminates all the stuff you cannot

predict and this is really what we do

there's no way that you know if if I

observe the left part of this room here

and I kind of pan the camera towards the

right there's no way any video

prediction System including humans can

predict what every one of you looks like

or predict the texture on the wall or

the texture of the wood U on the on the

hardwood floor um there's a lot of

things that we just simply cannot

predict and so instead of insisting that

we should make a probabilistic

prediction about stuff that we cannot

predict let's just not predict it learn

a representation in which all of those

details are essentially eliminated so

that the prediction is much simpler it

may still we need to be uh

non-deterministic but at least we

simplify the problem so there's various

flavors of those jetpad which I'm not

going to go into some of which have

latent variables some of which have our

action condition so I'm I'm going to

talk about the action condition because

that's uh the the most interesting one

because they really are World models

right so you have an encoder X is

current state of the world or current

observation SX is current state of the

world you feel an action to a predictor

which you imagine taking and the

predictor which is a world model

predicts the representation of the next

state of the world um and that's how you

can do planning okay so um you need to
