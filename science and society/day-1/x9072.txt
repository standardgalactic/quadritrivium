you know so one of the other guarded

secrets you know of llms is like in

which order and what is the DAT

proportions of data sets we use for

pre-training and how many times we

change in

and so this is uh this is something that

you know we we normally have as a humans

right there's a teachers and there is

like you know Educators and PhD in in

teaching that designed curriculums uh

you know for the you know for the you

know for the maths right and you know

sometimes you know to you know sometimes

we designed wrongly like so when when I

was born like 1981 you know in Slovakia

they had this thing called oh we have a

new way of teaching mathematics it's

called like the you know French new

school so let's apply it there and so I

I learned about these bourbaki method so

first thing I learned is sets and then I

learned that numbers are cardinalities

of sets right and this was not very good

you know at least you know was we had

very hard time as kids I was six right

to understand that you know that

subtraction is like some set operation

uh but you know we recovered you know

you know we changed the regime and now

like we we discover mathematics in the

way that human discovered and this is

something that we're trying to somehow

learning I think we still didn't you

know have a final answer what is good or

what is not in curriculum learning right

so you know one of the you know tricks

of deep six that you know they they even

pre-train pre pre-or data with high

quality data right something that we

don't typically do elsewhere well anyway

let's let's go to specific application

so if we do in context luming practice

you know there you know this is already

you know you know raging industry of

rack uh you know we provide few context

example to Lon to solve the new problem

problem right so in context example one

two and question you know you know these

numbers you one one digit number two
