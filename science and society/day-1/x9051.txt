language okay now there is context you

know somebody wrote context in a

language you understand now the context

is in Japanese how do you feel about

that well the context helps right well

it's a bit the same I believe is what is

happening but I was surprised by the

effect this was a hypothesis and when we

went and tried we ended up realizing it

has a lot of value and so I think the

future will be about models where you

could literally talk to your DNA

sequence and say what is in there can

you explain and sort of have this

interactive Discovery dialogue with

whatever modality you're you're dealing

with

yeah maybe so I I guess just to try to

continue in that vein does that mean

that for example if we try to get even

more context in another multimodal way

for example you feed it feed in the

model I don't know some way of

representing the evolutionary history of

the of of life on Earth through all the

three four billion years and then you

give it that kind of context say this

species has evolved throughout in this

way can we suspect that then it would be

even more per it would have an even

better performance on such task as the

tasks as the one that you described it

depends on the task if if the sort of

like the tree of life and its evolution

is relevant to the task probably yes

yeah but it's actually a good question

there is a research paper which shows

you that if you have actually plenty of

sequences you can figure out sort of

like the temporality of them in many

cases not perfect but like I don't tell

you which one before which one with

language models you can reconstitute

this very well so so yes there is value

there yeah we have another question

there short question please and short

answer please yes yeah I'm going to make

it short thanks for the presentation um

when you talk about DNA then become very

sensitive in terms of data set for the
