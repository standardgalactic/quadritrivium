all how do we know what's in the world

okay statistics all right if you ask

Chad gbt how sure are you about what you

just wrote it will say something and I

think I've tried it a bunch of times

they'll say yeah I'm very very sure and

here's why and blah blah blah blah blah

blah and you'll say but wait a minute

there's this other way to think and say

picture okay so what's going to happen

in the future we don't know and it's

really amazing how much uncertainty

there is in our

lives um really amazing um we are not

just sitting there reasoning our way

through like math problems we are living

in the world of I don't know what's

going to happen to me later today

tomorrow next year there all kinds of

things but we do well somehow all right

now in statistics we know how to talk

about some amount of uncertainty um you

know you got that data that implies that

there's this you know aor bar and so on

so forth but uncertainty is much broader

than that uncertainty has to do with

what you know that I don't know and how
