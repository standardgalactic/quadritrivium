of uh you know is just giving people

more of a range but we think that that

small range is actually as much as

people get excited about some of the

capabilities of these really big models

um you know that can be very expensive

to run we think that for an Enterprise

to actually deploy some of these

Solutions those smaller models are in

much more of a sweet spot in cost today

the other thing I I want to point out

too is that every year um if you look at

the the the actual capabilities of a 70

billion parameter model last year or

even 9 months ago versus an 8 billion

parameter model today we're actually

continually packing down more and more

capability as the whole field gets

better at every part of this process of

making these models so we think that

that's kind of going to be a Sweet Spot

Lane uh for lots of people to work in

for a long time and then finally you

know trusted you know you know if you

buy them through IBM we we indemnify

them we're actually one of the reasons

why we wanted to have our own models was

because we want to infuse these in all

of our products they're currently

infused into you know 20 plus products

at IBM and to even consider indemnifying

them we have to have a level of control

and transparency that we weren't able to

get consistently in the market and then

we also of course want to have have them

be responsible and safe so that's that's

granted we have a whole series of models

I'm mainly showing this to give you the

little bit of the sense of the the

philosophy of this and one thing you'll

notice immediately is obviously we're

releasing them in in various sizes but

we're also releasing them with tools

like these Guardian models which is a

trend that others like meta does this

with with lard um where there's a ining

awareness that a model isn't just a

model by itself you need to have guard

rail models around it you might want to

you probably need to have embedding
