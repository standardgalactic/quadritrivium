growth of of the energy usage of

computing and lm's generative AI is one

of is clearly one of the biggest drivers

and you know it's accelerating this

trend um the other the thing that's nice

about this though is that this is one of

those rare cases where the negative

externalities of a business activity

actually are pretty well aligned with

the incentives of the business so so the

more compute you use the more expensive

it is the cost is is aligned with the

negative externality of climate change

and and things like that um and then you

know that was The Good the Bad and then

if we look at the ugly there's also this

um this trend around you know like we're

not sure what's in the model um you know

maybe there you know there have been

various cases where uh it's been

revealed that that uh model providers

without you know telling anyone we maybe

using other people's copyrighted content

without without compensation or without

uh credit um so so there's a little bit

of a murky sort of sense here and all of

this is to say that when we want to put

uh an actual solution in a business to

to solve some problem these are all

factors that are going to work against

you so you know the energy cost the

overall cost um you know concerns about

what's in the data non-transparency uh

you know both functional and

non-functional costs and then the end

result you know from a from a business

impact statement uh sort of standpoint

is that again Gartner is estimating that

at least 30% of every generative AI

project um that reaches proof of concept

is going to be abandoned by the end of

2025 uh and they even sort of say this

is a conservative estimate so something

is wrong people are building things uh

this is the successful proof of concept

you've already done the proof of concept

and then you just don't go forward with

it so um you know there's something that

that we still need to get right about

this whole equation and you know our
