chat transcripts uh a customer service

transcripts and then asking 80 questions

about it which had which drove business

value like was there a technician sent

out or did the person mention a

competitor things that would be

interesting for them to know so they

could could use it for sort of their own

operations the performance of the

model um they were using gbd4 to do this

at a cost of you know mid singled

digigit millions of dollars and by

simply customizing a 7 billion parameter

model on their data not completely

shackling it to that task but giving it

just a little bit more information about

what the company wanted to to do they

could make it

93.6% cheaper so almost 20 times cheaper

uh CU you're using this little model

that's that's again it it knows your

company but it doesn't necessarily you

know know Advanced physics and all that

so this is a huge um you know potential

cost lever and it also transmutes you

from being sort of a passive recipient

of the technology all this exciting

technology do you want to be a passive

recipient of it or do you want to be

part of the creation process and I think

that shift is it's something that open

source and open communities can enable

and that's something that we're very

passionate about so um with that I'll

stop for questions because I got the the

five minute Mark um and very happy to

answer any questions you might

have thanks a lot

David yeah we have time for couple of

couple

questions yeah there

yeah hello um I wanted to ask a question

regarding the energy cost the increasing

energy cost of the artificial

intelligence and I was wondering if um

IBM or the community in general has

plans to implement Quantum Computing on

the side to kind of offload some of the

energy costs to improve the the curve as

you were saying in the beginning
