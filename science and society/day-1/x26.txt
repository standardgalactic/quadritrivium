markets actually really help they are a

good platform for starting to buildings

Now where's the AI and all that well you

know behind the scenes so I I was

involved in this in designing this

system there's a great deal of data flow

there's a it's a matching Market with

adaptive you know who listen to what and

what kind of music is it there's also

Market design principles there's

mechanism design here okay there's

contract theory and mechanism design

throws it at them it's because they're

been incentivized in a market to

three layer data markets this work with

Ali

rala postto with me and who was with ASU

Oar who's here uh so here's a system we

were studying where there's users

platforms and data buyers all right so

users are people like you and me we come

in like say to the you know to a credit

card platform we want to get a service

which is financial service so by using

the service data flows to them they get
