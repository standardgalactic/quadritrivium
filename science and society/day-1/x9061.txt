it's a computer vision you know problem

I would say from the image to the

Diagnostics uh it works pretty well so

this is already used right it's not

science fiction uh I hope it can get

better but it's already the no the

performance is already good enough to be

uh to be useful in the

clins now how how do you made these

models what you could say it's just you

know computer vision model AI on image

input is an image output is a

Diagnostics you need well a data set

with image and Diagnostics you train it

Etc uh what we've been doing at you know

at Ain and others are doing the same is

saying instead of of taking a standard

computer vision system that that has

been you know pretrained at gole or meta

you know the the good ones what about

trying to make a specific one for for

pathology and an approach to do that is

to use this concept of foundation models

right to say well if I can collect lots

of histopathology images you know they

are a bit strange they represent cells

they are pinkish maybe I should

pre-train a model to learn to rec to

understand these images and then find

you need to solve my tasks so this is

what we did I will uh I can skip that if

you're interested on How to Train

Foundation models in images maybe I'm

not even the best exp expert but

basically you invent tasks that don't

require any label it's just from an

image you generate problems that you

optimize and then you get an embedding

of the image uh and so we did that a

couple of years ago uh and you know

compared so it's two years ago it's like

so long ago in the field of AI uh it was

but it was one of the first Foundation

models for pathology and at the time

when we published it it just worked much

better than other models that that that

were using computer systems not

pre-trained specific specifically for

histopathology right so for example you

know we we uh in the publication and
