complex questions like you know the

incentive is there like people are

working on this already um and and the

economic incentive is really what drives

everything so it's not like people are

not are neglecting the issue or not

working on it um the other thing is that

the the hyperscalers most many of them

have goals to be carbon neutral some of

them already are So Meta is actually

government neutral in his operation not

in its supply chain but its operation

and it does

by you know buying renewable credits

basically because you can't power a data

center with solar power right because at

night you need to run it right um and uh

but it's the the biggest buyer of

renewable energy in the US is is meta so

you say the incentive is there ultimate

it's about putting it into place I'm

going to make a link between

sustainability and ethics ASU because

you know it is a something that needs to

be done something that needs to be put

in place how do we ensure that uh

transparency and uh

explainability remain at the Forefront

of discussions about a because some of

these ideas are so complex that the

average person is not necessarily going

to be able to

relate um it's a very good question U I

think it's sort of a you know

multipronged approach is needed here uh

you know we need to make sure that U you

know tomorrow's workers uh researchers

uh students are all you know more

cognizant of AI tools what they're

capable of uh you know what their

limitations are um on the other hand uh

I think I focus a lot on this human AI

interaction um you know how AI tools can

help uh humans and human decision makers

and there I think a big focus on uh what

I refer to as legible uh understandable

architectures are uh very important U

for these models to reach their

potential U without legibility there's

already some evidence that uh you know
