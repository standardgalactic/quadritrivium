LM there who's making an optimal quote

unquote decision on based on uncertainty

you got to say wait a minute what's the

context okay so I want to start thinking

about a vision of let's call it AI which

I hate to do but I'll do it because

yanan's in the room um sorry joh I like

to tease him

um uh I want to have one where

information flows between entities of a

collective now I don't want just this

kind of notion of a graph where I have a

node and there's a certain amount of

data there and it flows it's just like

internet of things or something I want

to recognize that these entities possess

knowledge and they may may or may not

want to share it they may have

competitive Advantage I want to think

more about these as asymmetries and

information flows in an economic setting

okay um so asymmetries of information

are critical in in economics if I'm

working with someone they why am I

working with them well they know how to

do something I don't know how to do all

right and so they know something I don't

know and so if we start talking about

how we get a price how how much money I

give you well I I don't know enough to

tell them the best price because they

know something I don't know they're not

going to just tell me they'll

lie so economics is full of mechanisms

that allow you to make progress in that

situation where everybody gets something

good out of it okay that's called

asymmetry of information to me that's

another kind of

uncertainty okay if I'm working with you

you know something I don't know that I'm

uncertain about something and that's not

statistical uncertainty that's not going

to go away at the rate one one over

square of

n okay all right so these things are all

linked up we want to use our technology

now this burgeoning technology not just

to build you llms on a hill with all

this uh power usage but we want to
