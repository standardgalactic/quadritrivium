design okay so this is the vision and

and again many groups are working on on

that super

exciting jumping to to another level uh

and which will be closer to what what

we've been doing at Arin and and bi

Optimus uh you know one cell is nice but

if you study cancer is not one cell so

there are cancer cells but they may

damage because they are surrounded by

millions billions of other cells there

is a notion of ecosystem where you have

a mix of cancer cells normal cells

immune cells and to understand the

disease you need to understand that so

understanding a cell is not enough you

want to understand many of them uh how

do you get data from many cells well one

option is is to move to a different

technology uh Imaging so this you know

this is an image that for those of you

who have been impacted or you know

friends or family confronted with cancer

these are images that you see in the

hospitals if you get a biopsy you know

doctor looks at your biopsy under the

microscope to try to do a diagnosis to

understand the disease this is what you

see okay so here that's another scale of

biology where uh you know there are

massive images and when you do the

microscope you see these little dots on

the right which are individual cells

okay so the ones that I discussed before

now they are they form complex things

and understanding this this complexity

is also key to understand for example

what's called immunotherapy right

immunotherapy is a kind of treatment

that activates your immune system that

only works if the organization of the

cancer is is you know fits swim or

therapy uh so it's interesting to do AI

as a you know example of things that

already work on the market this is you

know one of the products that that Arin

has has developed which is used in

hospitals you can use AI for automated

Diagnostics so you have an image you try

a model uh an AI model from the image so
