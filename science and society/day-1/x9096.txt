was uh and then they gave it the name

k218b K2 is the Kepler 2 mission uh 18b

um so I think star number 18 Planet B in

that system uh and that was interesting

because this subsequent characterization

resulted in knowledge of the orbit and

uh people found out that it's uh it's

basically in a potentially habitable

orbit so this uh dark green area is the

area where water could be liquid so it's

neither too far away nor too close to

the host St

so that made the news and people were

well it that didn't yet make the news

but the astronomers were starting to get

interested but then a few years later

people used the Hubble telescope and

found water in the atmosphere of this

planet and it was the first uh

potentially habit the the first

habitable zone exoplant where people

found water and uh and that made the

news and I I first didn't connected

because I didn't remember it was

k218b until I got a call from my

collaborator in New York David hog um

the astronomer who said well did you

notice this is one of our

exoplanets uh so that was a nice and

lucky coincidence but actually it uh

this the this streak of luck continued

and then later they also found um carbon

based molecules uh uh using another

space Tel the the James we telescope

they found carbon dioxide and methane in

the atmosphere I think it was also saw

first and uh and they found the evidence

uh so the astronomers particularly this

guy here astronomer in Cambridge he came

up with this notion of a what he calls a

hen World hen is a world composed of

hydrogen and ocean so probably he has

argued and seems to be more or less

accepted this planet has is covered by a

water ocean all the way around uh and uh

and a hydrogen at osphere above the

water

ocean um so it's quite it's quite an

intriguing object for

astrobiology and uh U there's even there
