can of interact with each other and and

everything um the system has just

learned this through you know observing

a bunch of uh uh State action next state

um and this works in a lot of situations

for you know arms and moving through

mazes and pushing a te around and and

things like that so

um okay and I'm not sure why I came

back um we've applied kind of similar

idea to navigation but interest of time

I'm just going to skip um so this is you

know basically sequences of videos where

a frame is uh is taken at one time and

then the robot moves and you know

through odometry you know by how much

the robot has moved you get the next

frame and so you just train a system to

predict what the world is going to look

like if you take a particular motion uh

action and what you can do next is you

can tell a system like you know navigate

to that Point um and it it will it will

do it and you know avoid obstacles on

the way this is very new

work but let me go to the conclusion so

I'm having a number of uh

recommendations abandon generative

models the most popular method today

that everybody is working on stop

working on this you work on jads those

are not generative models they predict

in representation space probably SE

models because it's intractable

use energy based

models uh M have have had like a 20

year contentious discussion about this

um abandon contractive methods in favor

of those regularized methods abandon

reinforcement learning but that I've

been saying for a long time we know it's

inefficient um you have to use

reinforcement learning really as a last

result when your model is inaccurate or

or your cost function is inaccurate um

but if you are interested in leveli just

don't work on llm there's no point I

mean in fact if you are in Academia

don't work on LM because you're in

competition with like hundreds of people
