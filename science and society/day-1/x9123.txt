runtime okay at inference time you know

people are excited about

um um you know test time computation and

blah blah blah as if it was something

new this is completely classical in

optimal control this is called Model

predictive control it's been around with

us

for about the same time that I've been

around all right um the first paper is

on you know planning using using models

of this type using optimization are from

the early 60s um the the ones that

actually learned the model are more

recent they're more from the 70s from

France

actually um it's called edcom um some

people in optimal control might know

about this um but you know it's very

simple concept this works amazingly well

so let me skip to the video

because okay so let's say you have this

uh little t-shape and you want to push

it into a particular um position and so

you know which position it has to go to

because you put an image of that

position run to the enod and that gives

you a Target state in representation

space um let me play that video

again okay so at the top you see what

actually happens in the real world when

you take a sequence of actions that is

plannned and what you see at the bot

bottom is the internal mental prediction

of what the system of the sequence of

actions the system was planning and this

is run to a decoder that produces a

pictorial representation of the internal

state but that is trained separately

there's no image generation um let me

skip to the more interesting one so here

is one where you have an initial state

which is a bunch of Blue Chips

randomly thrown on the floor and the

target state is at the top and what you

see here are the actions that are

result from planning and the robot like

accomplishing those actions the Dynamics

of this environment is actually fairly

complicated because those blue Chiefs
