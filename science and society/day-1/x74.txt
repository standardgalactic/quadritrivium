modalities with language but you know

it's going to require you know

development it's going to require uh

additional applications I think

traditionally you know things like

computer vision have been obviously the

computer vision Community wanted to come

along

and you know participate and we have

Vision Transformers and we have

multimodal uh Vision language models but

then there are other domains like time

series which are actually quite like

classical in some sense uh and super

important for business where there's

been relatively less attention and and

you know there these are some of the

things we're working on we're actually

finding that you you can build pretty

pretty good time series uh models and

but we're just uh getting started and

then thinking about how that mixes

together so it it's an interesting

example of pulling together different

different dis disciplines sometimes

older disciplines bringing them back and

combining them and and not necessarily

accepting the sort of narrative that

people sometimes do that it's just one

model will just sort of organically do

everything I think I think bringing

those those different disciplines

together is actually really important

and enriches both both

sides maybe I can also uh add to the

accent discussions so far um I want to

maybe uh raise uh two additional

challenges One tech technical one and

another cultural one the technical one

is that you know we've seen success of

large language models and with many

people you know uh believe that uh you

know that laads out a very good good

technical role map you just make model

bigger you replace a language data with

other data and then you go the same

routine and hopefully you get something

amazing but the truth is that every

science every data and every problem are

very different for example people say
