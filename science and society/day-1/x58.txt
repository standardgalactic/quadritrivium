earlier was used at the starting point

to train Alpha fold you feed raw data to

the model here the particular sequence s

i fs y I'm not going to read it all

represents a protein known as t149 also

identified at 6

y4f ultimately I Alpha predicts the St

structure of this protein which is an

adesive Adin tip protein crucial for

bacterial

attachment the central diagram outlines

what alphafold does and Eric also had a

beautiful one in his presentation

evolutionary and physical constraints

were built into the architecture along

with the

learning and in the full end to end

system there's a recycling stage that

iteratively refine the structure

prediction on the right you see the

final product a visual repres entation

of the predicted 3D structure this

ribbon diagram shows the protein's

backbone folding into its functional

shape the 93.5 gdt IND indicates the

high confidence in the accuracy of this

prediction DDT stands for Global

distance test it's a measure of

similarity between the predicted and the

experimentally determined protein

structure AI models like Alpha can

predict protein structures but how do we

know that those predictions are accurate

and this is something we heard earlier

this morning as well how can we conf can

we be confident in the prediction of

those

models this slide highlights The crucial

ability here of the models to assess

their own confidence giving us a measure

of reliability for different parts of a

predicted

protein on the left you see a protein

structure with segments that are

colorcoded by confidence level dark blue

mean very high confidence the model is

quite certain about the structure in

those

regions lighter shades of blue yellow

orange show decreasing confidence notied
