was very very exciting when we heard

that news and not only it is uh

recognized in the AI field it is also

widely recognized in the the general

public you see now a wide spectrum of

applications of generative Ai and you

know large models in across the field

you know uh in you know language you

know in image and the video and uh in

science people are talking about you

know maybe the whole way of life will be

colleague sitting in right here you know

were less optimistic because you know it

is uh you know uh very very true that

you know there are lot of limitations in
