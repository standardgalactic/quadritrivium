like standard question is if you do a

chemical perturbation if you give a drug

you don't really care only about whether

the drug binds the protein this is

useful but the real thing you care about

is if the drug cures the patient right

and so it's a sequence of things like

the the the drug should bind the protein

which itself if per should change the

cell which in the middle of many other

cells changes the tissue Etc so all of

these you know important questions can

only be addressed if we manage to

connect the dots between the modalities

and between the

scales how do we do that this is very

very you know this is mostly open so I

would just share a few things that we

did that a few open IDs uh for example

one ID is to try to say well we can

formulate this transfer of scales you

know as a translation problem like if

you give me an image of a tissue

histopathology can you it's made of

millions of cells can you uh for each of

the cells predict uh the the identity of

the cell in terms of the genes which are

expressed right so typically that would

be two different Technologies uh that

would be two different scales but maybe

using if you have a foundation models

for images a foundation model for cells

maybe you can try to align them to

connect them but here there is a notion

of one is a you know small thing that

makes the other one um these are

practical use cases by the way because

you know there are Technologies to

measure each cell in a tissue but

typically it takes about

$10,000 to obtain one patient data

whereas to get an image is $10 so if we

had an AI technology that could in

silico predict what you get for $10,000

from $10 you can imagine there is some

you know Market not only an e economic

benefit but a possibility to scale the

data collection you know to massive to

large numbers because there are many

images and not many spal transcriptor
