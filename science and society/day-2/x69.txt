talking about 10 of

billions and this exponential growth

highlights not only the promise of AI

but also the agency of ensuring that

research remains at the Forefront

guiding this technological

Revolution and I am not only referring

to what alphabet meta or Microsoft

invest in a single year

at the other end of the economic chain

AI related stock values are also

skyrocketing with markets following

Trends so complex that even AI itself

I'm not sure can really understand I

mean the the the rational behind it but

AI represents an iman's economic

Challenge and above all I believe that

AI really is a research

challenge it's no coincidence that these

scientific days open the summit for

action on artificial intelligence it's a

clear signal that research is essential

in this field I'm not saying this simply

because in the face of the vast Su in

involved it might seem easier to return

to the fundamental research I say it

really because I'm convinced of it

because the long history of AI from its

origin in in the 50s with aling and and

the DM Workshop to CH GPT today and deep

seek it really shows us that at the

Earth at the very core of AI we do have

research and we are not at the end of

the day we are not only optimizing

current systems I mean there are there

are there are new breakthroughs that are

really under ways that are being done

today in your research labs and it's

very very important to invest today in

research buying vast computing power is

important but it will not be enough we

must continue continue research efforts

across all areas of AI learning models

such of course as reinforcement learning

which Still Remains too

slow agent based AI which will be

crucial for Robotics and raise profound

questions about security system Rob

robustness and Trust continuous learning

essential which is essential for
