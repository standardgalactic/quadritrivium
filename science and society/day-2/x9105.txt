regulatory Giant and budgetary dwarf

that's what we are we have various tools

of economic policy in Europe mastri for

example we say deficit should not be

more than 3% of GDP we put on the same

footing you know spending on

Administration and spending on growth

and and green transition then we have

competition policy but in under the

protex of competition policy we preclude

any form of industrial policy we don't

have anything like DARPA you know the

defense Advanced project agency or the

Barda the bio we don't have anything

like that some people believe that the

European Innovation council is a darkar

it's nothing to do with a darkar it's a

bureaucratic thing to help existing

smmes we don't have that and the budget

European budget 1% of GDP so what can

you do and we the only time where we

allowed for more EU borrowing was the

was covid covid was perceived as an

emergency so we don't don't have the

tools in Europe you see to really say

you know in the US they have the DARPA

they have the IRA they have all what

they will invest now in AI they do huge

investment China it's enormous what

China has done I mean all the programs

that they had and and and Europe is not

there and and and we need to and and

it's not only Ukraine it seems that it's

only Ukraine that mobilizes people

Ukraine is very important very important

but it's not the only thing that should

mobilize us and well that's what I

wanted to

yeah

maybe just um thank you for um for these

thoughts um maybe as a conclusion I

would be curious to hear your thoughts

on um the most exciting opportunities um

for uh for us in terms of AI and uh

research and advancement so if I can

hear interview on that

um opportunities

well what excites me on the positive

side of AI is the applications of AI in

scientific discovery in fact uh people
