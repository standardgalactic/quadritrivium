to um steer and adapt uh the curricula

to um to students Gathering data being

able to monitor being able to

dynamically adjust to the students needs

but of course this comes again with a

very specialized qualification for the

teachers which can be a problem to be

able to really harness all the potential

and at the same time there is a the well

possibility H that there could be biases

introduced by the countries that are

developing these technology so the local

uh needs of communities uh in certain

areas in the global South in certain uh

culturally um special regions you're

going to lose those characteristics if

you're trying to develop Global AI

technology for education and and that's

also something that needs to be captured

by the models so this is something to

keep in mind as

well um in general and this is something

that has to do with the sg10 on

inequalities and 16 on the stable

institutions um the political

polarization that we have seen over the

these past years well is exacerbated by

AI so there is a big potential to

polarize societies and that's something

that is happening um I would also say

one of the strongest conclusions of our

article was that regulatory oversight

needs to come be needs to be preceded by

regulatory Insight so one needs to

involve EXP experts one is to involve

people who know what AI can and can't do

before regulating and and really have a

a global debate and mostly and more

importantly including everybody in this

dialogue because AI was going to impact

everybody's lives in 2020 and is

impacting everybody's lives nowadays

right so there's really a strong need to

to involve everybody on

this H we also did some work in terms of

a digal contract tracing during covid

here I want to highlight we put together

a soci technical framework that was also

quite much needed here I want to

highlight that is usually the governance
