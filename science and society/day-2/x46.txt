reinforcement learner was trained is

synthesized uh uh together

simultaneously uh to be able to do

formal verification of the policy uh

that was being generated by the Deep uh

reinforcement learner but if you just

look at the Deep thing itself then you

can only rely on experimental

validation and and then the scope well

uh was also already mentioned in the

previous talk uh the more knowledge

intensive systems typically have a

smaller scope and uh the uh other

systems and the or more general purpose

and like this uh llms that we have today

so it seems that we have to choose

somewhere uh but the good news is that

we can also

combine uh different of these algorithms

different of these par paradigms to

solve sub problems and then we come to

what is called today hybrid AI uh but

again this is not new there's a whole

tradition actually in hybrid AI

so it's not something uh we just find

out now uh and to show this this is for

example uh a picture of do tool neuros

symbolic learning and reasoning and so

that's like 10 years ago and there's a

whole uh research Community working on

these uh combinations of symbolic

representations and reasoning and then

for example uh small neuron networks to

ground the concept but even that is is

not uh that new and then I like to to

show uh a picture of a fuzzy system a

fuzzy sets were actually born or

invented in 65 so already long time ago

and and they were actually already

examples of this neuro fuzzy or neuros

symbolic uh systems where we had um a

symbolic layer that helped for

interpretability and also these fuzzy

sets were grounded um and the grounding

problem is a real problem in in AI but

that was um done in a very elegant way

if you ask me uh in in foruz he said and

here you see an example of of something

like a fuzzy control scheme but there

was other uh domains to which we could
