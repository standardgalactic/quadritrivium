upper panel are managerial jobs service

manager retail manager Financial Manager

Hotel manager each of the rows is

correspond to a managerial job on the

upper panel and you see that most of the

task are in the dark blue which are low

replacement risk so you see when AAL job

essentially you have very few tasks that

have high replacement risk so they are

okay they will survive you see what I

mean and and the best jobs in fact are

the one at the very top because you AI

replaces some task and will free time

for managers to concentrate on more

creative task so that's what with the

managerial if you go down to the

clerical job types travel Consultants

there you can see that AI uh is you know

the will substitute in most task the

replacement risk is very high on most

task so then using this you can map out

and what you can map out you you'll be

always there here what we do and that's

aono helped us with this we have a map

of front of jobs in France okay what you

have when you when you on the lower part

it's the low exposure jobs when you are

on the upper part is the high exposure

when you are on the left is the jobs for

which you have a very high share of tax

that are substitutable by AI High

replacement risk uh uh when you are on

the right is jobs where most of the task

are complimentary low replacement risk

so the worst is the Northwest the

Northwest are the jobs that are highly

exposed with many tasks that are likely

to be replaced for example accountant

telemarketer secretary you might think

whoa be careful okay but now you see

what and you could start from the upper

uh uh right you see accountant contab is

accountant telemarketer up to

secretaries and the jobs that you would

think on that basis are at risk is

somewhere in between telemarketers and

secretaries it would represent 10% of

the jobs that you would be at risk but

in fact I'm being too pessimistic there

why am I being pessimistic because what
