identification of excavation sites these

are just few examples but they point to

an undable real reality

today I believe it's nearly impossible

to maintain a Competitive Edge in Global

Research without Umbra embracing

artificial intelligence and this is a

two-way Dynamic AI models have also much

to gain from other science throw their

amazing amount of data and their

methodologies from this exchange I'm

pretty certain that this coveries of

Tomorrow Will emerge very very soon

this exchange of knowledge is made

possible thanks to institutions and

structures we are gathered here today at

e poly technique on the saal plateau and

institution that embodies French

scientific Excellence we are gathered in

France which is becoming for a few days

if you allow me to say so the center of

the world as far as AI is concerned and

I want to say or say again welcome and

come back anytime come here come here to

work to research to collaborate and to

stay to conduct fundamental AI research

to Foster the dialogue between Ai and

other science to contribute also to the

transfer of AI based Technologies this

Summit is not only a beginning it's not

an end it's a one step in our AI Journey

a journey you are all invited to take

part

in France is not just a place to study

AI it's also a place I believe to shape

the future we have tremendous Assets in

the global AI competition and allow me

to list few of

them we have worldclass

researchers working everyday in France

many of whom are here

today A very strong mathematical

expertise research infrastructures that

are the sometimes the Envy of our

International peers super super

computers available esec specifically

for research like Jean and soon Alis hok

two large

supercomputers and last night our

president of the French Republic Emanuel
