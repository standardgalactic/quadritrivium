interaction design experts in economy in

law in ethics we also had um experienced

people in biodiversity so we really

this was like a two-year Pro process of

workshops interactions discussions to

really be able to put together a quite

comprehensive analysis of each of the

targets and we are very lucky to have

for instance Virginia dickn who uh been

very active in AI ethics at the European

level um and also Max star from MIT who

has also been very um active in AI

sustainability and and basically the

future of AI so we're very likely to

have a very complete team and a very

Broad

discussion and uh the first thing that

we did was to split the 17 goals into

three main categories the society the

environment and the economy this is a

reasonably standard classification in

the Stockholm resilience Center also by

the UN but this will allow us to have a

quite U well holistic view of these

impacts in terms of positives and

negatives so we first divided all these

uh SGS into these three categories and

what we wanted to do was to uh really go

to the Target level so we follow the

same the following process we have um

for a particular SG in this case sg1 we

would have a two typically a couple of

experts who would do a first pass

through the literature this is research

articles research projects and even also

deployed um AI applications trying to

find evidence of whether AI can act as

an enabler or an inhibitor for that

particular Target of the s so in this

example we have for Target 1.1 that both

AI can be an enabler and an inhibitor

this is quite common that AI can act as

both it can help certain things but it

can also hinder the achievement of other

aspects within that Target and in this

particular case both Samy and Simone

were the experts who made the first

assessment of this Target and what we

did was to also have um an expert

elicitation process so we have in this
