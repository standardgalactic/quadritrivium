we did with Simo was to say well let's

go back and let's do the same regression

as we did let's look in our survey and

we know the occupations and we know we

can do the same uh regression of AI adop

employment on AI adoption but for the

subgroups of jobs in this map so first

if you look at the jobs with low

replacement risk you see no effect of AI

on employment Okay then if you go to the

northeast of this uh graph you you

concentrate you look at the effect of AI

adoption unemployment on those jobs

which have uh which are highly exposed

with complimentary occupation to AI

positive effect that's not very

surprising what's more surprising is

that if you go on the northwest the the

uh you know where you have those jobs

that are highly exposed with a high

share of task that are likely to be

replaced by AI you see still a positive

effect that was the surprise so we used

to have when I used to have an

accountant tele marketer I was you know

hiding myself say I'm sorry you will

lose your job and everything no no no no

no not so bad okay because in fact it

all depends on the use of AI you look at

if you look at AI use for production

processes or it security restricted to

these jobs which are highly exposed and

with a high share of task substitutable

by I still the effect is positive the

only case where it's negative is when

you have a slightly negative effect when

AI is used for administrative processes

and that's the thing so it's what it it

all depends so at the end of the day you

have much less than 5% of the jobs in

the short and medium term that are in

geop party uh uh it depends on whether

you are exposed or not on the share of

tasks that are likely to be replaced and

on the use of AI you are considering if

you you don't consider AI for production

processes or ICT no problem if you look

at AI for administrative there you might

have a problem but it's a very low uh

share of t i that bring me to the end
