deeps or it's equivalent to to provide

you with a different answer to what

should be done with Taiwan I mean you

see I mean that's kind of clear I mean

AI does what you tell them to do I mean

deeps will itself say we should have a

Taiwan independent

right I'm I'm sorry to say that uh the

science right now shows that AI doesn't

do what you tell it to do that is the

problem you tell it to do things like

you know be honest uh don't cheat but it

does okay so you you have many

experiments not just so in the case of

Taiwan also tell you Taiwan is

independent it will but it's very easy

to make it say the opposite okay so that

the problem is we we haven't found the

way to actually make it do the things we

ask it to do and in general it will do

the things that you ask it to do but

it's pretty easy to actually counter

that and in some cases it's not that

somebody is trying to defeat the AI it's

the AI itself that is cheating so let me

give you an example of a recent

experiment um the AI knows that it's

going to play a chess game against a

specialized chess program which is

actually stronger than these uh you know

very strong uh Frontier models and so

the AI wants to win and what does it do

it cheats uh it doesn't play the game it

changes the files that contain the the

the board game so so

you know that

that's so so you know and and and i'

I've talked this morning about other

examples and there's like the whole year

past year we see more and more of these

things happening the smarter they are

the more they

cheat so AI um just like human being has

some bias and some

um um

weaknesses you um perhaps the question

of geopolitical I would be curious to

hear your thoughts Philip from the

French and European perspective and the

AI Commission on um the key
