don't uh neither them nor I do actually

know what came before and it sometimes

feel like we've um when I look at what

was done before we've we don't we don't

really have that knowledge that historic

knowledge of what was done in AI before

and and so my question to that is it's a

bit specific so so you do you think that

um in order to maybe help students in

who want to learn AI um to have that

historical background we should learn

stuff that was done before like for

example should we

um give classes to students um give Lis

classes to students for example should

should now students who want to to learn

AI a learn lisp because I think I do

think that it's kind of a language right

if I talk to most of my classmates I'm

not even sure most of them know what

lisp is they all think it's python or or

or something else so do you think that

it should be taught uh yes I I think

definitely it should be taught of course

I don't mean that we should um only

stick to to old uh good AI as it is

sometimes called we but we have to

revisit uh these uh uh these

algorithms and uh knowing the the

history I think it's in any discipline

something that is very important so uh

I'm not teaching in in The Bachelor AI

roots of AI with the idea of uh teaching

this very uh where are the seeds planted

so I mentioned clo Shannon uh he had a

paper in 84 which is very relevant for

understanding uh how can uh we uh get

this performant llms by just doing an

next word

prediction um so I think it's an

eyeopener and and knowing the history of

a discipline is always uh a good thing

to my opinion thank you very

much thank

you uh do we have any more other

question the

audience so may thank you very much an

again and

so so now last but not least I call our

last speaker for the session Sasha Loni
