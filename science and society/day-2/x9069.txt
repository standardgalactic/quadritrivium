sounds pretty good we don't have to work

anymore right and what do you get well

clay ploty you could have as much clay

plotter you could fill this entire room

all the way to the ceiling with clay

pots we could have tunics beautiful

Greek tunics uh if you if your horse

drawn cart was broken it could repair it

you could even make a new horse drawn

cart if you're sick no problem it could

burn incense for you and you could you

wouldn't have to have a human burning

the incense anymore well you can quickly

see that although the good news is you

have no more labor need you really

wouldn't have living standards that were

all that much higher I mean after some

point the clay pots get a little boring

right I mean we want other things we

want to have iPhones and and and jets

and all the other things so simply

having the existing task and automating

them is not the way most economic growth

occurs it may seem like the poll point

is to take labor out but that's actually

the smallest part of economic growth

most economic growth comes from new good

goods and services doing new things

we've never done

before there's a second reason that it's

really bad and that is that it creates a

trap I call it the Turing trap and the

basic idea of the Turing trap is that

productivity as I said earlier is output

divided by input so that's typically

operationalized as GDP per hour worked

now suppose labor hours go to zero what

happens to

productivity Infinity wow it's hard to

get much better than infinity right so

we now have infinite productivity that's

kind of nice what happens to labor

income oh wait a minute that also goes

to zero so now you have infinite output

zero labor income if you're a laborer

and that's your only source of income

and you're not in on the deal to get

some of that other stuff that's not

really good so productivity is not

everything even when it's infinite we
