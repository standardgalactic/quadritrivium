because these models are more expensive

and it was really interesting because I

never thought about this before but

Meredith brought it up because she said

well you know who's who's providing this

like AI specific compute gpus right like

Microsoft uh Google and who's training

the big AI models that apparently are

the good ones Microsoft Google Etc right

and so it's like kind of like if you

convince people that the biggest model

is the best model then they also get

more money from deploying that model and

people using that model and so that's

something I had never thought about

before and I was like yeah it's true

that you know if you say that the 400

billion parameter model is better than

the 12 billion parameter model then

people are going to pay more to use it

and so there's really this question of

of money and and affordance that's very

closely linked to sustainability and so

we see these Market concentration we see

it in gpus for example that are getting

more and more expensive um so that's

also an issue that has links between

ethics and

sustainability and we're starting to see

this a little bit in headlines so for

example Taiwan had a drought a couple of

years ago and essentially the government

stopped Farmers from planting crops in

order to use that water for Fabs for

making um microprocessors gpus and other

chips in Taiwan and so you know that was

it was really a question of okay we only

have water for one of the two so they

they went with profit um we're having

you know CEOs of big tech companies

saying that AI depends on an energy

breakthrough but where that where where

that breakthrough is is going to come

from and when it's going to come in the

meantime you know the energy is mostly

non-renewable and that's kind of a given

while we wait for this energy

breakthrough to arrive um and also Rare

Earth elements um if this is something

that interests you there's a there's um
