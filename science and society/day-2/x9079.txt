would move up to uh 1.5 you see what I

mean so that's a huge it's almost

doubling

okay so now remember that this is still

an underestimate because I didn't take

into account the fact that AI automates

also the production of ideas okay and uh

uh uh so in fact instead of having the

red curve the red would be if I had only

AI automating task in the production of

good and says you would have this higher

slope for 10 years and then going back

to the slope of the dotted line but in

fact you also improve the innovation

technology AI also makes idea easier to

find and therefore you get to the light

blue curve higher growth initially and

permanently higher growth and you

mentioned that paper Eric by toner

Rogers this student this MIT student

what toner Roger does he exploits the

randomized introduction of an AI tool

for material discoveries in a in a a

large US firm that in fact focuses on

application of Material Science in

healthcare Optics and Industrial

manufacturing and again you compare the

research productivity of those who have

access to AI to that of those who don't

have access to Ai and so the author

looks at the ai's impact on materials

Discovery and his Downstream effect of

patenting and product Innovation so what

happens that you figure out on computer

how many materials you can produce then

you have patents and then you have

product prototypes and what he finds is

this those who have access to AI they

they they figure out

44% additional materials on computer

that leads to almost 40% additional

patent filings and at the end of the day

177% more product prototypes uh

generated so it's a huge boost in the

innovation

technology I love Bob Gordon he's a

great friend of mine but I tell Bob look

ideas are not permanently harder to find

I tell the same to Chad by the way who

is also my coor and and on agrees that
