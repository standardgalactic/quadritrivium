Footprints of in different countries so

I think they took India and the US and

they said well you know if you divide

that gross carbon footprint which is

calculated in a way that's not

representative of our behaviors right

it's an average it's an average for all

the people who live in a certain country

and so they calculated that and they

said well you know on average so this is

how much how many GRS a CO2 and AI will

emit for generating 100 Words and this

is how much time it'll take on average

for a human living in India or the US to

to to write these words like an author

and so by by taking the carbon footprint

of one and the other we can say that AI

is more environmentally friendly than

human beings like and they did this for

text writing and they did this for image

generation so essentially artists and

writers um so yeah AI writing

produces I can't read that 130 to 1500

times less CO2 per page than a human

author you know what's what are the

implications of this right does that

mean that we should replace all authors

by by AI does that mean that you know

we're not good for the planet somehow

and AI is better for the planet it's

it's so hard to quantify these things

right but in a footnote or in a

paragraph somewhere they say emissions

uh analyses do not account for social

impacts such as professional

displacement legality and rebound

effects right there's also there's

always like a little footnote somewhere

but I think for me the the point of the

matter is is that it's really hard to

compare humans and machines even for

specific tasks like this one because

there's always going to be generation

and also because humans are more than

just what they do as a profession right

you can't just take a gross carbon

footprint and say well you're an author

this is this is your carbon footprint

that's you know if you divide that by

the number of hours in a day that's
