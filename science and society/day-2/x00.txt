also learn lessons from the past

ineffective regulatory instruments and

adverse effects like barriers to

Innovation can be avoided if we look at

the past experience of environmental

regulation across the globe um so let me

tell you about some lessons that we can

learn from past experience the first one

comes from the US experience of

environmental laws which showed us that

um The Limited common and control that

is the unilateral imposition of Norm by

government and best available technology

strategies that is the unilateral

imposition of the use of one precise

technology by a government don't work

why because they do not push regulates

to innovate and and to compete in

developing the most coste efficient ways

to

surpass climate objectives for

example and

that's why we saw the emergence of a

concept called cor regulation where the

determination of the means to comply

with regulatory objectives or social

objectives are delegated to the

regulates who know better the technology

and we can compete between them to

develop the most cost efficient ways to

reach these objectives or even to

surpass them if there are if they are

incentiv to do

so secondly lesson is that there is no

one size fits all solution some argues

in the some argue in the AI sphere that

we we should let actors

self-regulate what the experience of

nuclear safety regulation shows us for

example is that self-regulation can work

only if the interests of all actors are

aligned in the in the nuclear safety uh

regulation you can think of the General

Public the nuclear operator and the

government each have the same interest

in preventing nuclear accidents but to

prevent the uh uh harm to the

environment but also because one single

nuclear accident in the world can lead

to the end of the entire nuclear
