trillions and trillions of dollars worth

of value that previously we couldn't

access it's a big economic Game

Changer the final chart I want to show

you from this uh this study is this

chart a Paro chart as you see if we took

all the questions that came up and we

look at the most common question there

on the far left and the least common

questions on the right you see a power

law or Paro curve some questions are

very common oh oh how do I change my

password I'm locked out how do I turn

the system on um those come up a lot

other questions are very obscure this

was a a tax Financial question and

sometimes people would ask a question

that had never appeared in the data

before it was the first time we ever saw

it so there's a long tale of unique

questions now machine learning works as

I just said by looking at all the data

and learning from it which questions do

you think machine learning is going to

be better

at well of course it's going to be

better at questions that there's a lot

of data for so machine learning did

better on the questions to the left of

the spectrum and humans did better on

the ones on the right humans I don't

think we're great at dealing with

exceptions but we're still at least for

now better than machines and I know some

people in the audience are working on

addressing that but in the system that

we're looking at right here uh the

humans had an advantage so there's a

natural division of labor the machines

handled more of the common repeated

questions especially actually the middle

was one where they added the most value

because everybody was able to do the

very common questions and then humans

were better at the right and of course

you don't know in advance what the

question's going to be arrows parad docs

and so you have to have the human in the

loop and they figure out okay this is a

question the machine can help me with or
