ai's carbon footprint estimation like my

own I totally put myself in this bucket

doesn't talk about Justice doesn't talk

about equality doesn't talk about the

who can afford to train large language

models we tend to talk about how much

energy they use and how many carbon

emissions they emit so these are really

two separate communities with different

conferences different journals and um

via my work at hugging face I've

realized that there's actually a lot of

overlap between the two and it's worth

considering them together and so um the

main thesis uh of my of my presentation

that I'll keep revisiting all along is

that we need to make a more deliberate

connection between AI ethics and

sustainability so that if we're studying

ethics ethical ramifications we need to

also think about impacts on the

environment so I'll start I'll start

also with the sustainable development

goals um that Ricardo talked about um

and essentially as he said sustainable

development I mean formally speaking it

was defined in the bruntland report U

this particular this particular

definition comes from the bruntland

report in 1987 that talks about

development that meets the needs of of

the present without compromising the

ability of future generations to meet

their own needs so this is really like

the core definition of sustainability

and then we have the UN sdgs that were

inspired by this definition and the sdgs

have inspired AI for good work so it's

really inter if you trace it back you

can really go back this idea of

sustainability in the

SGS um and in terms of sustainable

development work um there's different

kinds of factors that are talked about

different kinds of threads of the

communication so there's green AI Frugal

AI uh it's really funny here here more

in France they talk about Frugal AI it's

not a thing in North America as far as I

know there's efficient ai ai for climate
