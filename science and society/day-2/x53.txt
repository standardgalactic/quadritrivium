computational sustainability lots of

people working at different different

sides of the of the problem different

different issues that they're trying to

tackle right and there's no single Forum

also what's interesting is that you know

people who are working on kind of

Hardware optimization like the question

that came up recently tend to not go to

uh climate change AI events because it's

not the same kind of group of people

it's not the same forums and this is

actually why conferences Summits like

this one are so important because you

have people who are stepping out of

their comfort zone a little bit and

meeting people uh from policy from

Academia right and and and talking about

transversal topics

um and in any case this work tends to to

talk about things like very specific

aspects right carbon F estimation Energy

Efficiency optimization but where how

that fits together into a puzzle is is

is kind of overlooked it's not something

that people typically talk about and so

in terms of in terms of the research

that exists um essentially the first

paper that came out on ni ni and carbon

footprint estimation was trell at all in

2019 um it became kind of the first flag

planted in the ground about how many car

how many t T of carbon are emitted when

trading um a large language model so um

that they estimated that with a full

neural architecture search so

essentially a full exploration of the

different possibilities um of how uh the

language model is set up so not just the

training but really like the whole

experimentation they estimated uh

626,000 pounds of uh of CO2 and since

then um other people like myself like

the the bottom um the bottom table is

for my paper I did in 2023 we've been

working to to get more information to

get more Nuance to get more um more

analyses of different aspects of the

architecture and the training

procedure but we haven't talked about
