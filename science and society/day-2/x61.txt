was accepted to I clear in Europe's icml

and try to reproduce it try to replicate

the results and in something like over

90% of the cases they couldn't there was

not enough uh details in scientific

Publications in order to replicate

results and even if the code was

available and the data was available and

you know all the details were were

available there was always something

missing a random seed or you know some

optimization parameter that the that the

authors failed to mention because we're

not good as a community of communicating

about our research to each other and so

it's actually pretty um pretty wild if

you think about it because that means

that how do we really meaningfully build

upon each other's research if we can't

even replicate it if we can't even

validate these findings and so

essentially in terms of um SCI scient

scientifical um um the the the fact of

the matter is that we're relying on

things that are not made to be

interpretable that not made to be

replicable and that you know if you

build um a house with a with a with a

shaky Foundation then the rest of the

house can also

Break um and it's and if you talk about

sustainability something that you know I

I kind of tell myself or I I truly

believe this actually is that if we can

replicate each other's work it it comes

with a sustainability benefit so we

don't have to keep reproducing the same

things right and uh part of the reason

why I came to work at hugging phas when

I had offers from other places was I I

truly believe that you know a a hub for

sharing AI models has a sustainability

benefit because you know you don't have

to start from scratch you can adapt

models that already exist and so for me

like the hippie and me was like reduce

revie recycle and then essentially went

to work at hugging face and so I think

that transparency the more information

we give the more um scientifically uh
