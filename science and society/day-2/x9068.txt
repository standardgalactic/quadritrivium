that's how they measure it can we take

this let's define a task that humans are

doing and let's see if we can get make a

machine do the exact same task um and so

over time you start making machines more

and more like that now why is that a bad

idea well for two main reasons first off

no offense to to my human friends but

simply being as good as a human is not

ambitious enough it's it's not really

that high a bar imagine if Henry Ford

was uh uh designing a new vehicle a new

car and he said we're going to make it

walk or even run as fast as a human

would have been kind of lame don't you

think it wouldn't have been a very

ambitious goal this ven diagram gives

you a sense if the white area is all the

things that we humans can do focusing

simply on making the black area bigger

and bigger is limited because look at

all that shaded area outside of it

there's so many new things that no human

has ever done before that we can now

start doing you know machines can fly at

supersonic speeds machines can see

things in the X-ray Spectrum or infrared

machines can manipulate things at the

nanometer scale machines can do all

sorts of computation they can scan

through the web and find uh documents

they can do calculations even my my

ordinary calculator can do calculations

that I can't do so all these

capabilities should be going for things

that no human can do imitating humans is

a very low bar and we should not simply

do

that and here's a way of thinking about

how damaging that is economically um I

mentioned the Deus uh designed uh robots

supposedly uh over 3,000 years ago 3,500

years ago so imagine that he it wasn't

just a myth imagine he had really done

it and imagine that he had successfully

followed uh the Turing test and said

we're going to make the robots do all

the tasks that Greeks do that we do and

we're going to have machines do all of

the labor in Greek society well that
