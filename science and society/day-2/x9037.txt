about what Paradigm will dominate there

are three paradigms as I see it

currently operative in the world and

right now in the US we're watching One

Paradigm do its best to achieve Victory

through the form of the work that Elon

Musk is leading with do the department

of governmental efficiency but what are

the three paradigms let me go ahead and

name the three paradigms and then after

I'll I do that I'll say a bit more about

the fight that I see unfolding right

now so for starters there is the

Paradigm that comes out of the thinking

of people like Peter teal and some folks

call that the corporate libertarian

Paradigm for governance um I tend to

call it a paradig that is about the

combination of network network States

and the power of capital there is a

whole body of work and writing and

thinking that goes by the name of nrx um

thought and ideology I'm curious how

many of you for how many of you is that

a familiar label nrx is that a handful

all right so nrx stands for Neo

reactionary and there are a cluster of

people in Silicon Valley Peter teal also

uh balage Easter Nason and others who

fueled by a very powerful libertarianism

a commitment to Freedom generally are of

the view that true Freedom yields

Capital success success in the

marketplace corporate success that

success is driven by natural talent and

those who have achieved it should be

freed left liberated completely to

continue accelerating Innovation driving

Innovation forward um for the sake of

discovering what's possible for Humanity

and that they can through building out

communities of Excellence connected

through technology at this point often

functioning in sort of blockchain

communities and the like develop Network

States hollow out State institutions

acquire governance and directive power

um and steer the world constantly for

the benefit of capital for fettering

human Innovation for seeing what human
