Insider um

on the

2024 AI power list yes 24 2024 was the

year of lists for me thank you very much

okay go

ahead so I know you're all pretty much

looking forward to lunch at this point

so I will try to try to keep it brief

and also I'm very much appreciating the

order of speakers today because uh

Thomas started it very uh down to earth

and then I think that we have been

increasingly broadening the scope and

broadening the the the reflection and

the critique and in terms of history and

well I'm going to broaden it even more

and talk about ethics and sustainability

and um why they're connected so I think

we're going to go to get a bird's eye

view of the whole Space together so just

um as an introduction I mean some of

some of the work you've heard today but

other work you've heard in previous

academic conferences maybe you've heard

some AI ethics work um typically ethics

and sustainability don't really cross

paths um essentially as ethical

principles fairness uh you know bias

things like that don't talk about

environmental impacts they they

typically focus on you know figuring out

whether facial recognition is racist or

sexist um and conversely work around
