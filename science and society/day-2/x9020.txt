attack and defend from safety side

actually many people were building you

know better attackers better Defenders

but I think from the more scientific

point of view what has to be realized

now is that when we gather all the

attackers and Defenders all together

what has been found is that none of the

attackers can actually crack all the

Defenders and none of the Defenders can

actually handle all the attackers so let

me be so so let's be Frank from a

scientific point of view none of them

are good enough to save ourselves I

think this is the state state of theond

um so I I don't think we get to pick one

risk against another as you said um

somehow in terms of policy we need to

address all of them um you asked about

sever it and likelihood I think this is

a very important consideration when you

think about different risks um so as Nua

said there are risks that you know the

likelihood is 100% because it's already

happening and it's measured um there are

risks um whose severity is much worse so

terrorists using AI to you know in ways

that could kill millions of people is

clearly a very high severity risk um as

you know there are many people including

myself who worry that we could lose

control to these uh systems and you know

potentially uh you know having these

systems trying to take over um societies

and that that severity is very very high

but the likelihood is it's not that it's

low you don't know what it is you know

different people have different opinions

you can look at different um scenarios

so really to be um how could I say uh

wise about these we we can't choose one

against the other now there's one risk

that we didn't that didn't talk about

and we didn't talk about here yet which

I think deserves more attention and that

is the concentration of power risk as as

we see that you know it's taking a lot

of capital and talent and just a couple

of countries in the world right now are

uh leading that effort uh I think this
