standards and and addressing many of the

the challenges and and you know we both

showed um uh the Aiden Tona Rogers

result that that you there was evidence

of of remarkable improvements and there

are more and more um systems that are

specifically being designed to help with

scientific discovery going back to uh

Alpha fold and these are tool Bas tool

systems not necessarily agentic that

that more and more scientists are

beginning to use I'm beginning to use I

encourage all of you to start using uh

deep research and some of the other

tools four or five months ago I found

these tools to be not all that helpful

it's just a sea change now in terms of

its ability to really help me formulate

things I to admit I was kind of annoyed

one time when I I I thought I had an

original idea and I was thinking about

it and then I asked the tool to help me

with it and it it kind of spat out a lot

of the things that I had been privately

thinking uh I had FedEd my papers so

maybe it had a little bit of a head

start um but it it's remarkable how it's

able to not just synthesize across a lot

of things but also even you know

increasingly I think you'd have to call

it some original uh thinking the second

thing I want to emphasize is the one

thing we talked about at the beginning I

think most of us did which is this uh

opportunity to continue to use AI to to

work closely with humans and I I think

there's been enough of an emphasis and I

talked about the the Turning trap and

just simply having AI imitate and

replace humans I think it's a very

destructive Direction both in terms of

the output it can create and also the

way um value is distributed um when I

talk to managers which I spent a lot of

time talking to CEOs there seems to be a

a very sort of lazy thinking that we

have a task and we're going to have a

machine do that task and replace it and

they're almost always disappointed

because it turns out to be a lot harder
