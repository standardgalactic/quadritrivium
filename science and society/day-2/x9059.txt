technology um and he points out that we

have a bit of a productivity Paradox

that is to say we have amazing

Technologies no doubt you saw the first

slide I put up with some amazing

progress but we don't see it showing up

in the productivity numbers um

productivity growth was about 2.6 per

year percent per year in the United

States in the 90s and early 2000s and

since then it's only been about half as

fast 1.2% less than half as fast uh in

recent years um and it's not just the

United States if you look at almost

every oecd country uh you have a similar

slowdown France had a similar Slowdown

not the exception the exception is

Greece but who knows what's going on in

Greece um so um and then we got the more

recent data I updated this the data came

in for uh productivity in 2023 I was a

little bit excited that it looked like

maybe we're beginning to see a jump up

but in 2024 it sort of uh leveled off

again uh the last quarter which just

came out yesterday uh on Janu on

February 6 um showed that uh

productivity in the US was back down to

1.2% that quarter so basically the same

as what we saw before we're really not

seeing this amazing technology show up

in the productivity statistics um here's

a graphical way of showing it that Jason

Ferman just tweeted a few hours ago so I

managed to get it into the slides um you

can see that there's a weird thing that

happened during the pandemic where a lot

of low skill low productivity workers

dropped out of the labor force but the

dotted line is sort of the trend and you

can see we're almost exactly on the

trend and there's you know maybe in 2023

it was going a little faster but now

it's really back right on Trend and uh I

don't see any U big surge of

productivity there in the macro numbers

yet we're seeing it in specific

applications like the call center

software but we're not seeing it in the

official data and again it's it's pretty
