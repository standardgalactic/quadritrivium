we gave them um one area that I'm not an

expert in but we had several uh

economists really weighing in on is the

potential effect on uh labor markets um

and like in many of these uh risks the

uh you know views vary quite a lot from

from one expert to another um but really

the important message here across the

board for governments and and scientists

is that there's uh a lot of uncertainty

and uh we need to study these things uh

better and we need to invest in the

research needed to uh mitigate those

risks um before they you know become uh

really uh uh at a scale that we can't

handle okay so um I'll I'm already like

over my time uh no not yet um so I want

to say a few words about some of the

things we added in the new report that

was not in the uh interim report uh in

particular we we have a whole section on

open weight models uh which is a term

maybe different from what you've heard

of Open Source and the reason is

companies will share

um the code that allows to use the model

and that includes the weights but not

how it was trained which is by the way

information that would be very useful

for scientists and there's actually a

whole uh you know uh list of uh variants

of of different amounts of sharing and

different kinds of sharing you you see

barely in the table that that is

important to understand um it's also

important to understand the pros and the

cons of um open weight models so they

clearly um uh facilitate transparency

this is a positive thing for society

they facilitate Innovation because they

they make these uh systems that can cost

a lot of money accessible to smaller

players and they facilitate research in

AI I mean academics uh really thrive on

uh having that access including in

safety um but you also have to recognize

that they can facilitate malicious or

misguided use um if a system syst is

open sourced and you have some um safety

precautions safety uh mitigations um uh
