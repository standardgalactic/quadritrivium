use data in order to generate insights

to optimize systems to better predict

the the weather to optimize energy grids

actually to make them more efficient so

there's all sorts of things that are

like intrinsically things that AI is

really really good at that can be used

in the context of fighting climate

change so it's actually there there's a

whole field of study around this and

there's all sorts of people that are

doing really cool work in applying you

know kind of existing AI algorithms that

we've trained on I don't know imet or or

mist or whatever but applying it to

climate specific problems and there's

like uh a lot of potential there as well

there's also the fact that there is

carbon- free energy there are car carbon

offsets renewable energy credits what's

interesting is that so there's this

whole I mean carbon offsets is something

that most people know but in energy

there's also carbon offsets and actually

the big technology companies have been

the biggest purchasers of these offsets

for for decades and also they are um the

biggest purchases of purchasers of um

what are called Power purchase

agreements so essentially they um make

agreement like far into the future like

5 10 years with renewable energy

providers saying we will buy energy from

you even in 10 years so that gives them

money in order to build for example wind

farms and solar and solar panels so this

is a way for them to kind of mitigate

the risk of having to put up you know

whatever $5 million to to to build a

bunch of solar panels while you have

these agreements that make sure that you

have money so it's not all bad there

there are like there are good good

impacts um and of course as many of you

have noticed gpus have gotten faster

phones can do all sorts of cool stuff

now like also the hardware is also

getting better right so you know people

always say well you know now I can run

things locally on my phone maybe it's
