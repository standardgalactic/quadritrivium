for potentially using some of its data

and New York Times is suing suing open

AI I don't know whether deep seek is

suing New York Times yet but um a lot of

companies are suing each other right now

to try to uh determine who is the right

part of the problem is of course that

that these laws were written before llms

or any other these Technologies existed

so it's not quite clear copyright

literally bans you from making an exact

copy or something very similar and so

the the uh uh big llm companies are

arguing that okay this is this is not

we're producing original output that's

not identical to what went in um that

said the purpose of copyright um is to

provide incentives for creating valuable

content um it's in the US Constitution I

think there's something similar in in

other countries um so if your goal is to

encourage people you know uh authors to

write books and poems and do original

investigative reporting you need to

provide incentives for them to do that

work otherwise if they have no

incentives they they won't do it maybe

some of them will do it for you know the

goodness of their heart as volunteers

but in general you want to have some of

the rewards flow back to them that means

you need a new Paradigm and so right now

uh a group of us uh uh Zoe hitzig uh

Gabriel anger and I are working on a

economic Paradigm that that's that just

you know starts from scratch set aside

what the existing court rulings and laws

are ideally what would economic

incentives would you want to provide and

the answer of course is you do want to

provide some of the benefits to flow

back to the original creators you also

want some incentives for the llm

creators to to to use that you want some

incentives for the downstream groups to

take advantage of them and um depending

on how important each of those parties

are to the ultimate value creation you

want to have have more of the value flow

to them so we're developing a a model
