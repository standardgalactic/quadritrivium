to be around uh Power and that when we

no longer have our labor power that

gives us um bargaining power and forces

Society to give us some compensation if

if if they don't if you don't pay a

farmer or you don't pay a factory worker

you don't pay a professor then you don't

get their output but in the future we

won't have that kind of Leverage anymore

and then whoever controls the technology

that creates this value uh hopefully

they'll be benevolent uh perhaps we can

create some kinds of checks and balances

that that enforce that but but I think

that's going to be a new kind of uh

economic and political system that we

need to start designing now so that we

don't suddenly end up in a place we

don't want to be thank

you I sure I think I think that many I

mean we saw the example of the

researcher there they find you know with

AI many more possible you know uh

material designs okay so so it enlarg

the the amount of it so then you need

judgment or maybe maybe the machine will

have the Judgment but it's we we need a

human to make some choice and some

ethical Choice as well I think that's uh

a doctor I can see AI helping but you

need a human element to to take care of

the Elder for example would we think

that only robots would do that or only

or with think the human element and so I

think I I I really see AI as a tool that

will allow us to do much more and that's

one thing and and and the other thing I

mentioned that you know Prosperity is

the and happiness is the joint outcome

of technology and institutions who will

do the institutional reforms do we think

that the is only the AI that will change

that will change competition policy that

will put in place the flex security

system those are social thing is a

social movement that determines that and

we know that the technology without the

institution we they will not deliver the

prosperity we want so I I can see in

many respects you know that it will make
