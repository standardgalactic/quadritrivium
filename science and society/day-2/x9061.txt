a lot of truth to it to address this

we've created a new metric we call GDP

DB the b stands for measuring the

benefits instead of the costs even if

Wikipedia costs zero it still creates

some benefit some of us would be willing

to pay 10 20 $50 a month to not um lose

Wikipedia to can still still have access

to Wikipedia that means we're getting

perhaps $50 a month of value but that

doesn't show up in the official

statistics if we did count that and we

count the other metrics we would have a

much better measure so in the in the

coming year we will I will publish a uh

paper we've already done it for

Wikipedia and other Goods we're going to

do it for a broad section of traditional

goods and digital goods and what you'll

see is that there are trillions of

dollars worth of um value being created

by these digital Goods that GDP and

productivity is not capturing I we still

want to have official GDP there's also

these well-being metrics like happiness

on a scale of 1 to 10 but GDP B I think

is filling a gap there to be a little

bit more precise and still capture some

of the

benefits while mismeasuring is important

I actually don't think that's the main

reason for this productivity Paradox the

main reason is that AI is a GPT and I

know you guys uh the machine Learning

Community think oh yeah General gender

pre-rain Transformer no I'm talking

about general purpose technology

Economist had the acronym GPT first

although we've lost it um general

purpose Technologies Drive economic

growth and they had these three

characteristics that Tim bresnahan and

Manuel tratenberg identified they are

pervasive they affect almost all parts

of the economy they improve on over time

let's face it few things improve as

rapidly as AI I just showed you and most

importantly they spawn compliment

innovations that is you can build new

things on top of them they enable new
