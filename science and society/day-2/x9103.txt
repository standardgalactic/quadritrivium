AI and why because we don't have the

ecosystem to to produce uh and the

problem with Europe is that Europe gets

it act together in emergency when we had

covid H we we have to react the Ukraine

war Putin ah Putin okay we react and we

don't perceive the the losing to the US

and the decline and the EUR and the the

technological decline of Europe Visa

both the US and China still yet as an

emergency you see what I mean and that's

the big problem in Europe and that's why

it you know people like dragy like have

to fight to say no we should waste no

time we need a true single Market we

need a true Financial ecosystem and we

need truly uh you know in Innovation

policy uh industrial policy and

Innovation policy in Europe to put us to

up to standards of of those countries

that are you know investing so much and

and I don't know yet that Europe will be

able to do it and the question is do we

do that the 20 all countries in Europe

do we align on the mean or we do

Coalition of the willing I believe

personally in Coalition of the willing I

believe that on AI we should partner we

we should team up with with those who

want to do things not with those who

don't want to do things that should

include the UK by the way they are

willing to do things and and I think we

need a new Dynamic for Europe to wake up

because otherwise we are really becoming

insignificant China raising uh us being

also still at the head and and Europe uh

declining and uh that's that's I think

is a big uh it's a kind of huge concern

I want to add something about

insignificance uh from the economic

perspective I'm not an economist but I

think there are simple things that I can

anticipate uh as plausible uh when we

get to Super intelligence systems

economically you guys talked about the

jobs but there's another issue which is

that I I can I can see from the

Declarations that are made and you know

what you know logically these people
