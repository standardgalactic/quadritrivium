not so bad maybe we won't need data

centers as much in in a couple of years

and so that's kind of the debate but

it's not the whole story there are other

things in this debate that go overlooked

and this is um what I'll talk about

mostly today so um we recently wrote a

paper with uh EMS Trel from car melon

and Kate Crawford uh from Microsoft

about uh the indirect environment mental

impacts of AI and it was really

interesting because it was a long time

coming we working on it for about a year

and a half um and it was kind of you

know it was so complex and we were kind

of like just losing our enthusiasm and

they were like no we're going to get it

done we're gonna going to get it done by

January 2025 so finally we did and then

uh that next week uh satian Adella so

the CEO of Microsoft tweeted something

about jeevan's Paradox and our paper

like essentially came out the next day

so it was really was very timely um but

also took a lot of thought and a lot of

kind of um system systemic approaches to

um environmental impacts and so um

essentially we try to think about all

the rebound effects that AI can have

that aren't covered by what I just

presented and so um essentially things

that are material things that are um

econ economic and things are that are

social so these three categories of

effects that tend to get overlooked when

we're talking about ai's direct

environmental impacts and so both Kate

and Emma um came with a lot of kind of

really interesting ideas about well you

know this is something that we don't

tend to see as an environmental impact

of AI because we see it as just like

just an economic thing or just a social

thing so we're really trying to um

connect the dots on this and actually if

you you were here from my presentation

this earlier this morning I talked about

how important it is to consider ethics

and sustainability together and so this

is part of that as well like when you
