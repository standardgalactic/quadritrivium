is improving more and more rapidly um

almost as fast as somebody can think of

a new Benchmark uh AI researchers are

often able to address it so we're really

in some very unusual times the reason I

put the the the dotted line there is

just to give you a little bit of

calibration about how well humans do on

those same

benchmarks and as an economist that's a

very interesting number that's an

interesting threshold it's almost like

the the boiling point of water when the

temperature crosses that point then you

have a phase change and in this case you

have a phase change in the economy when

you go from having humans be the best at

doing something to having machines be

the best at doing something then if

you're an entrepreneur or a manager

you're going to look for ways of

switching over from humans to machines

in more and more tasks for now there's

still uh many tasks hundreds of

thousands of tasks where humans are

better but as you can see there's more

and more where um Ai and related

Technologies are beginning to match or

even exceed human

capabilities another report I recently

worked on and finished is for the

National Academy of Sciences in the

United States um Tom Mitchell who's a

professor who founded the machine

learning uh department at Carnegie melon

and I co-chaired a committee with a

bunch of other uh uh uh experts in

economic

and computer science and sociology and

some business folks and this one's a

little short it's only 130 pages but

it's focused more on the effect of AI on

the future of work and there are a

number of different chapters there

including on productivity which I'm

going to draw on on labor on measurement

and other categories and one of the

things we see is we looked at the way

that the jobs are changing already you

can see some job changes this particular
