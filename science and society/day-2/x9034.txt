matter of my basic family inheritance so

on my father's side my grandfather in

the 1940s helped found one of the first

chapters in Northern Florida of an

organization called the

NAACP the National Association for the

advancement of colored people and that

was an organization that fought for the

right to vote fought in the Civil Rights

Movement when my granddad did that work

it was a super dangerous time lynchings

in the South were on the rise so he was

was literally taking his life into his

hands to secure the right to vote on my

mother's side of my family my great

grandparents help fight for women's

right to vote so my great Granddad

marched on Boston Common our big Public

Square in Boston in

1917 to make the case for women's right

to vote so from both sides of my family

I come from people who see

empowerment as the Bedrock for human

thriving and well being my granddad was

willing to put all material concern to

the side for the sake of securing the

right to vote believing that humans

flourish most when they can steer their

own lives in the private sphere and also

in the public sphere working together

that's the commitment I bring into my

work that commitment to basic human

empowerment has obviously been

profoundly challenged in recent decades

by the structure of our economy by how

technology is developing by specific

political unfoldings in the United

States and elsewhere around the world

but the point that I want to make

today is that that project of human

empowerment is

basic human beings are not merely

creatures of bread we don't survive on

bread alone we survive also through

respect for dignity through the respect

for that spark in each one of us which

is about our capacity to judge and

choose regardless of the level

regardless of the caliber of our

expertise we all have that so what are
