Danielle Lee uh did a nice paper where

she found that the opposite that a

system could be used to have uh fairer

buying more representative more

diversity as well as higher overall uh

performance similar results have been

found in Bank lending in medical triage

and what was the third one oh parole

parole systems so um just anecdotally I

was talking to a uh uh my uh my Uber

driver

recently and he was complaining that

with when he was working at the taxi

company the human dispatcher was very

biased he thought they were always

giving the good rides to his friends and

he was one of the Insiders and he

preferred this system where it was just

based on the algorithm so I want to say

that that if we if we've all been saying

the panel if we can steer the technology

in a way that creates a broader more

fair outcome it actually can do better

than humans because after all the sad

news is as we all know humans are pretty

biased they often concentrate power

among themselves it's difficult to

remove racism sexism and other um biases

from humans it's often more possible to

address those in algorithms and create

systems that automatically check for at

least some of the more common kinds of

of challenges so done right I think that

these can be powerful tools to create

more diversity more fairness and uh and

better

outcomes Thank you very much for this

very inspiring discussion um and thank

you everyone for

listening just to Echo what Alice said

there thank you so much to our panel it

was riveting great to have you with us

today uh that brings us to the end of

our two-day conference just like that we

don't know where the time has gone it's

absolutely flown by thank you to you our
