at our

disposal so in all sectors uh we can see

that AI can help us optimize our

resources and get a better knowledge um

of the climate change and the

researchers before me have shown how it

can be used uh for the sdgs for the

sustainable development goals in France

uh we believe that using AI for the

ecological transition has to be done on

the ground with local authorities and we

have funded 12 projects uh with local

authorities to really use AI for

optimizing their resources their um um

reduced water leakages or optimize the

energy consumption of the public

buildings but we also talked about uh

the necessity yes uh to better to have a

better knowledge of all the resource and

energy consumption uh of AI because we

need to make sure that the cost benefit

analysis is positive here Thomas Lov in

his presentation talk about electric

cars we had to do some work in the

beginning about electric cars to make

sure that it was really uh going in the

right way for the ecological transition

for AI it's the same we need the data

and we need the science to make sure

that the cost benefit analysis of AI is

going to be

positive so for wider adoption we need

the facts we need the science and we

need the transparency and I'm also going

to make a quick link uh with the two

days of the AI action Summit that are

going to take place on the 10th and the

11th where all the leaders are going to

meet CEOs heads of government

and heads of states and uh it's a great

thing that for the first time the

environmental sustainability of AI will

be a key topic of this AI action Summit

with announcement that will be made and

we hope that this AI action Summit will

be a stepping stone for increased

International collaboration on the

environmental sustainability of AI I'm

not going to be any longer thank you

very much to all the researchers and I
