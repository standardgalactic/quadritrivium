political economy where people like

Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman gave

us a different picture of how State

capacity should be employed they made

the argument that we should deregulate

as much as possible let price and Market

steer as much as possible power

Innovation to the maximal degree and

we've been living through the last 30

years through an economy around the

globe that has shown us the effects of

the neoliberal model with Incredible

concentrations of wealth inequality and

income inequality especially in the most

developed economies and all around the

world as people pursued that second

model the focus was on the idea that

productivity Collective aggregate output

would increase well-being that would

lift poverty lift people out of poverty

generally improve human

situations but the challenge with that

model for all that that was true and

Global poverty has been reduced the

challenge with that model is that it

neglected human dignity

that drive for empowerment that I

described by referring to the work of my

grandfather and so all around the world

we've watched as people have risen

people frustrated by the fact that

technocratic economic systems have been

unresponsive to them and so we're living

in a moment I'm sure you've heard many

people argue this where liberal

democracy is under challenge where that

neoliberal economic Paradigm has

collapsed

where we're all seeking a new way

forward how are we going to organize

human life for the good of

all now it's in that context that the

world of technology has an exceptional

importance your field the field of AI

development the world of Engineers is

the world that has put the new paradigms

on the table that will shape political I

institutions and Economic Institutions

and social institutions for the future

and we are currently having a battle
