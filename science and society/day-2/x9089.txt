building AI to living in a world built

on AI um I think um you provided very uh

complementary and uh yes insightful

thoughts um to start this discussion I

would like um to discuss um to ask you

this question uh on a transformative AI

that you've just uh discussed so as you

extensively studied the impact on uh

you see AI um transforming uh our world

we're entering Uncharted Territory uh

Philipe in his earlier talk um this was

a great talk he just gave now he also

gave it another talk and he made the

point that it's very difficult to get

data about the future and so we do have

a challenge when that comes to it and

yosua mentioned also that we're we're

we're uh uh going in areas that is very

hard to predict that said I do think

there are some parts of it that we can

uh foresee okay and I think it's it's

almost inevitable that the that the

basic technology AI will become much

more powerful I mean even just every

week I see something that I I didn't
