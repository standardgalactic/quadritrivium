Upstream segments of the AI value chain

are very much dominated by large firms

you have three uh Superstar firms in the

cloud Amazon Google Microsoft you have

one big actor GPU on the market for

graphic processes so the problem we have

is that already now at the beginning the

Upstream segments of the I value chain

are highly known competitive and that's

why it's very important and in the

report we insisted open source access to

data not too many regulation the AI act

in Europe has too many regulations that

becomes an impediment to competition

because the large firms they know how to

deal with the regulations but the small

firms they don't know how to deal when

there are too many I need regulation but

I need the right amount and not too many

because it's an impediment to

competition so there is a whole part of

the report where you need adapt to

competition policy so at the end of the

day AI has a huge growth potential but

we need to adapt competition policy if

we don't adapt competition policy we

don't harness the power of AI okay so

that's on the growth side now let me

move to employment employment so in

joint work we did with Simo Xavier Sela

we were looking at the effect of

robotization again there I dis agreed

with Daron Daron thought that

robotization and automation would be bad

for employment in France it's been good

for employment firms that automated and

robotized they create employment here is

Industrial Equipment here is robots why

because of the productivity effect when

you robotize you become more productive

when you become more productive you

become more competitive and therefore

you you sell cheaper you see what I mean

or you have a better quality price ratio

so then the world demand for your

product increases and therefore you

employ more and that productivity effect

more than counteracts the substitution

effect a huge fight with Daron on that

and with otor and all these guys they
