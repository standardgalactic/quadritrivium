and also it is a very good illustration

of um what is called the conflict of

electricity use because when you

authorize a data centers to connect to

the grid maybe you put

um in priority in front of other public

interest uh projects and in the case of

marsill data centers have been prized

PRI prioritized over for example the

electrifications of uh the case the

arbor Harbor case uh which is key to

allow electric boats to come to to

Marseilles so there is also a problem of

conflicting use of um electricity

and and this I I won't dive into the

other environmental impacts because I

think other speakers after me will do

that way better than me we have a

problem of rebound effect we have

problem in terms of material needs uh

and a lot of stuff that we don't even uh

uh uh we can't even measure yet current

regulation Falls very short in um

addressing these environmental impacts

for example the European AI Act only

provides for documentation obligation of

the computational resources needed for

the development phase and only for

certain type of AI systems namely

highrisk AI systems that that are for

example system used in critical

infrastructures and general purpose AI

systems and models basically llms only a

documentation obligation and focus on

the development phase so not it ignores

completely operational emissions water

consumptions or material needs for

example um so sustainability the

sustainability in AI problem is what we

can call a wicked problem this is a term

coined in complexity economics to Define

problems um diff very difficult or

impossible to solve due to their

incomplete changing uh and changing

Natures it also Define problems for

which potential Solutions can be even

worse than the problem itself so very

complex uh problem and indeed the a

market is marked by a complexity

characteristics the first one is that it
