I decided to take those AI skills and

apply them in the fight against climate

change and so uh since then uh well so

quit my job I actually was working in

finance I was working at Morgan St

Stanley at the time so I diverged a

little bit and then um I went to work

with yosua Benjo who's the next uh

keynote speaker um in Ai and the

environment and so thinking about ai's

uh Butterfly Effects on the environment

the fact that these systems are so

interconnected right that even when

you're talking about AI to people who

don't necessarily know the field really

well it's sometimes even hard to Define

it's hard to pinpoint it's hard to

explain what we mean when we talk about

Ai and so they're interconnected uh they

have potentially huge impacts on society

especially when they're deployed in

things like health and things like

justice education right um these

relatively simple or in our view you

know tractable systems can have large

impacts on society and and on the

environment and so this is what I've

been working on uh the recent years

trying to understand what that impact is

and so today I want to talk to you about

the direct impacts of AI on the

environment because they're important

and they've been the core of my work um

and and other people's work in the

recent years but also the indirect

impacts of AI on the environment and

rebound effects so um these are kind of

the Three core types of um themes that

I'll I'll talk about so let's start with

uh ai's direct environmental impact so

some of you may have seen um new uh news

headlines like this um so training an AI

model can emit as much carbon as five

cars in their lifetimes uh Big Oil PL

Pro profiting from climate destruction

and conversely AI solving the climate

crisis right so obviously there's some

good and obviously there's some bad but

it can be hard to disentangle and

quantify the two so in terms of negative
