else for Power

grids and sure there are ways in which

adapting code is something that

generative AI algorithms can be useful

in doing but I would caution against

anybody doing that who doesn't already

know how to code anybody who's used um

uh a co-pilot tool knows that the kinds

of subtle errors that come up can only

be dealt with by somebody who already

knows some amount of coding and it's

it's like you know it's like any other

translation system you you shouldn't

trust it with something that's Mission

critical and with code you can get a lot

of subtle errors that you don't really

recognize so again I would say the

answer to this is teach more people how

to code and let them use co-pilot tools

as one form of assistive technology but

I don't think that that is the answer

either there's a question if we have

time for it couple row up so one more

last question no thank you very much um

do you think that a solution to reduce

um consumption of llms will be to make

like a hub in which the user input the

question and then there is a b that will

be undering yeah that's actually a

really that's a that's a really

promising area where you can sort of get

directed to a particular solver based

upon what you need right now we don't

have tools that are being designed to do

that but I would love to

have generative AI tools be used as what

they properly are interfaces they

interfaces they're not fundamentally

problem solvers and if they are

interfaces to bees that would alleviate

a lot of my concerns it would also mean

that you have to use them less right

because you fundamentally they're being

used to do the their job and not being

used in a million other places as

well okay so I'm I'm afraid I will use

my privilege of being chair to ask you a

question one more question last question

okay you know as as a dyslexic person

I'm very happy to use llm to help me to
