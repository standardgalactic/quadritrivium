market is the Danish model when you lose

your job in Denmark when in the US when

you lose your job you have enormous

stress and you showed that curve Eric

and case andus Deon you see this shows

the the mortality rate of unskilled uh

middle-aged Americans you see the The

Continuous curve it has gone up since

the 2000 because people when they lose

their job in the US they lose status

they lose access to health insurance and

they become very stressed they take

opioids and sleeping pits and mortality

rate has gone up but in in in uh in

Denmark our colleague Alexandra roule

has looked at the in Denmark what

happens when you lose your job for two

years you receive uh 90% of your salary

up to a certain level of salary the

state retrains you and helps you find a

new job if you refuse more than two jobs

in your qualification you have

unemployment insurance going down here

she compares the health of a worker in

Denmark in a firm that closes down to

the health of an identical worker Ur in

age education experience in a firm that

does not close down no effect of

becoming unemployed in Denmark on the

purchase of anti-depressants anti

anxiety and sleeping pills no effect on

the probability to visit a hospital for

circulatory problem no effect on

mortality so I think you see at the end

of the day you want to harness the

growth potential competition policies

the job creation potential education and

flex security and I wanted to say also

something and I'll be done in the report

we make it very important very stress

this point we need competition firster

competition open source e data access

whole value chain of of AI starting with

the cloud avoid excessive regulation but

on the other hand you need to invest in

computing power it's important so the

state plays a role State and private

sector uh in invest in AI diffusion and
