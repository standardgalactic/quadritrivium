case yoland then myself would be the the

experts and we try to have um experts

with a good knowledge on the topic being

a studied while the reviewers without

complimentary knowledge so maybe they

would not be very experienced in that

particular SG or that particular topic

but we wanted to have a bit of variety

being able to bring in some different

perspectives so there was a discussion

process through workshops and and

interaction to try to poke holes kind of

like a red team sort of thing so trying

to poke holes in the original argument

ation and the original assessment made

by the by the first experts right so for

and this is a very complete um Excel

file so you can see for each of the 169

targets H first of all the assessment of

positive or negative effect second you

can see a reasoning so there is a

paragraph here of why we make that

assessment and third what we have is a

references so we have three four

references for each of the 169 targets

so quite comprehensive work and uh after

there was converg in this expert

elicitation process then would report

both the positives and negatives this

data set is online so you can access and

go into all the details all the uh

intrate connections if you more

interested in in in all the evaluations

that we made I'm going to focus today on

few examples to highlight so let's um

let's look at some of the results what

we found is that 79% of the targets can

be positively affected by AI whereas 35%

can be negatively affected so this shows

in principle uh a positive message there

is a good potential we can really do a

lot of good if we can leverage AI in the

in the right way but of course we should

not undermine the negatives and this

connects also with a previous talk H

only one target being negatively

affected can have cascading events and

cascading interactions that can lead to

unexpected consequences this because the

sdg agenda is a highly interconnected
