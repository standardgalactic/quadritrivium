we have a whole chapter where we work

through um holton's theorem in a little

bit more detail um donon asoglu has a

widely cited paper where he works

through it and uh and uh uh Philipe and

uh and his co-author Brunell um have the

uh a paper that's I think probably the

best one which I'll show you briefly

some of the results from each of these

papers so first the one that um I did

with Martin Bailey and Anton corck

that's also the nationaly we estimate

about 40 to 50% of um the tasks could be

done with generative AI and this is um

based on the Elon do gpts or gpts paper

uh Daniel Rock one of my students was

involved in that paper as well um and

you could guesstimate how much each of

those tasks could be improved we use 20%

as a baseline uh that's sort of like

what we were seeing in our um call

center paper and some of the other

papers and if you multiply those two

together we got about an 8 to 10%

productivity Improvement very simple

calculation now that doesn't happen

instantly remember I showed you the J

curve um we don't get that all in the

first year say that happens over 10

years who knows exactly how long it will

take but if you spread that over 10

years then you get a gain of about 8% to

1% of additional productivity growth um

now that's just what the technology

today if you have some continuing

progress it's easy to imagine that the

gains will more than double to like 1.4

even 3% per year is what we put in the

National Academy study so that's one

kind of a number that that we put out

there just to to get a back of the

envelope number uh donon asamu has a

much more pessimistic uh oh yeah I

should say that um um I put a bet on

this with with Bob Gordon because he's a

pessimist so you can go to longb

bets.com and you can see our bet we have

a I have a bet that by the end of the

decade we will do better than this

number and and uh Bob has a bet they
