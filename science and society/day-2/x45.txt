there's more interaction that you need

with experts so it is more knowledge

intensive than the pure data driven

approach but I would uh always recommend

you if you just get data and you don't

know what the data is about then it's uh

not a good practice uh so if I'm invited

to to for example a company to help them

with a potential machine learning

problem I want to discuss the data I

want to see how the data is currently

used to better understand the data

because that makes me um much more uh in

a better position to decide how or which

algorithm I should

apply um if it comes to human

interaction yeah then uh in the past we

had mainly syntactic sugar kind of

interactions uh with uh the systems and

now we have this this big uh end to end

uh llms so the um experience you have in

terms of conversation is of course uh

increased uh with this llms yeah uh but

that doesn't mean that we cannot use

small LMS to interact and to to to solve

or to improve the syntactic sugar uh

situation we had in the

past if it comes to validation we can

get again another picture it swaps again

um expert systems or knowledge based

systems more in general and they apply

by formal reasoning they can generate

explanations so you can get

justifications for the conclusions that

are being drawn so uh I would see

they're better um compared to uh llms or

or other uh big um new networks that we

have today where we mainly have to rely

on experimental uh validation of course

what we can also do is uh

to take the output of a big uh deep Neal

network and to synthesize it into a

small smaller model of which we can

maybe prove something uh that's also uh

research that is uh being done we for

example did research on uh using deep

reinforcement learning techniques where

we then distill uh the policy in into a

more um um discretized model

uh also the environment in which the the
