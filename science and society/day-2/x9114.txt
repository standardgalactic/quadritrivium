solve this problem until we actually

rebalance um how power is operating and

with regard to Tech development so um

I'm sorry I keep coming back to the same

point but but I want to just thank you

for bringing up that important

issue go ahead go ahead go ahead no I I

you know that links to something I said

before you know the problem with it with

it you had the emergence of the

Superstar firms and then they dominated

and that's because competition policy

didn't adap that's really so we have to

regulate competition but it's important

to have all the time new actors that's a

very kind it's usual thing you have

revolutions you have emergence of big

actors and you want firms to grow you

want you want the good people to succeed

but you want to make sure they don't use

their power to prevent new newcomers and

and to monopolize and now to decide

about democracy you see I mean and

that's where Civil Society is so

important you see because very often you

you if you don't have Civil Society in

the the The Government Can Be by bought

out by the by the big incumbents you see

what I mean and then democracy is out

and that's why it's so important to have

the you know the the the the Civil

Society on top of government and firms

if you don't have that this third edge

of the triangle then you can you you are

up for the biggest dangers I think so I

share the concerns of of Philip and

Daniel and have written about that but

in the interest of balance I'm going to

say say a word in the support of

algorithmic systems because they can

often can reduce bias and reduce uh and

decentralize things I did papers looking

at recommender systems at Amazon and

they pushed uh smaller books smaller

records things that it's it prevented

the concentration of uh of a Paro curve

where we're just a few Big Winners um

there's studies looking at hiring

algorithmic systems of course we've all

heard how they can perpetuate bias but
