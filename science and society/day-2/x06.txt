you mean by co-regulation and how that

works across disciplines

thanks yes um vocabul vocabulary check

when I talk about regulation sometime my

students or people that come from other

disciplines and that are not familiar

with regulation do not share my

understanding of of Regulation that's

why I I I I want to to precite that

before answering your question because

it is very linked to to the idea of

co-regulation sometimes people think

that regulation is

legislation okay my view of Regulation

which is now getting more popular uh in

in the field in the legal field but also

in the design and computer science is

that regulation is all the action that

people do and that can have effect on

others that means that Engineers are as

co-regulator because they their design

choices contribute to regulating social

phenomena so we need once you

acknowledge that when you are building

legislation you your objective should be

to to leverage to leverage Market forces

and to incentive people to change the

way they design things because they are

the one co-regulating so we need to find

ways to incentive them to do choices

that contribute to the regulation

because it is not just a top down

approach but it it it acts in the in the

two uh ways so if our goal is to reach

sustainable AI we need um a bottom up

approach from Engineers to integrate the

sustainable practices in the design and

also action from the government to

incentive this type of of sustainable

practices so that's why I meant by cor

regulation thank you

with one more question

here front row microphone are

arriving this

here do you believe that

um this documentation only of the AI Act

is the only reason why big Tech allowed

it to pass can you repeat the end of

your question I'm not sure the this non

it's only documentation that needs to be
