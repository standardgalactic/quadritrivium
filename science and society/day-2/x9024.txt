systems and part of that we have a new

uh work uh a paper that we just released

on actually using AI for formal

mathematical reasoning and and also for

theor improving with a goal that we can

develop and utilize better of these AI

Technologies for through improving for

program verification so we can now not

just generate code but actually generate

proly secure and correct code and this

can help us build security systems as

well so so all these are examples how we

can better develop better approaches for

risk management and if I can add

something to this uh France is well

known for its strength in U math and

theory in machine learning and

particular but in other areas and I

think the whole area of safety is one

where um the traditional trial and error

that has worked well for you know deep

learning as I have been doing for many

decades um is not sufficient anymore

like we need um things like uh aounds

and other thetical constructs to make

sure we are going to be deploying

systems that are going to be safe for

the

public and Joshua you were mentioning in

your presentation the evidence dma um

how do you see the I mean how can we

help the policy maker navigate

this

dma well so there's uh evid I mean

there's a history uh in science of

dealing with uh dangerous experiments

and and uh uh you know things like um

human cloning for example um or

geoengineering what what is happening in

many of these areas is

that the potential severity of you know

the bad things that could happen um is

very high but at the same time we don't

have good mathematical models or

physical models uh you know in the case

of the climate we there are lots of

things we can predict but it's right now

very difficult to predict what will

happen if we introduce all kinds of

chemicals in the atmosphere in the case
