connections across lines of difference

build Bridges support those with social

cohesion we actually generate more

epistemic power for Humanity than when

we limit the number of people who are

making epistemic contributions to

Innovation so the plurality model starts

by recognizing that human cognition is

plural machine intelligence is plural

there is not one single thing there is

no graven image of intelligence that we

simply should be idolatrous replicating

rather there is a Divine spark in all of

us and that means as well that our

intelligence are multiple they come in

different forms some are good at this

and some at that and similarly again

with machines there too if we do our

work right we should be inventing a

multiplicity of kinds of intelligence in

machines not idolatrous simply replacing

one kind of intelligence only so that

plurality conception starts from that

picture of human beings sees the value

in that multiplicity sees the value in

Social societies again having diversity

and activating that for the common good

and then recognizes that when we have

diversity in society when we have social

heterogenity it doesn't automatically

yield the good it can yield tribalism it

can yield War it can yield oppression

and domination the challenge is always

how to take the potential benefit and

value of human pluralism and activate it

for the sake of the collective

flourishing of humanity so then that

question leads to a very different

picture of what tech development might

be about how do we build tools that help

us as the social creatures that we are

make the most out of our pluralism how

can we replace algorithms in social

media that drive outrage and division

with algorithms instead that Foster

bridge building that Foster collective

intelligence that support the overcoming

of divides I give you that concrete

example simply so that you can see that

our paradigms of development are a
