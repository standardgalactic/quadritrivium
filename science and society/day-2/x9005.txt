it's like oh where's the funding coming

from is it heart science is it social

science it's Al it's also like the

mechanisms are not always there but I I

do believe that this is one of the ways

in which we can create soot technical

tools

essentially um and I think that we need

more transparency and accountability in

terms of the AI industry and actually

this is one of the reasons I have such

high hopes for the Sumit is because

we're going to have people from industry

and Academia and policymaking in the

same room so hopefully we can converge

together on you know mechanisms for

accountability how do we really trace

the impacts who who Bears the

consequences right like we don't really

have any mechanisms currently in place

neither for environmental harms nor

societal harms right like who pays the

the cost of a of a biased sexist AI

system like if if it denies someone

their mortgage and they they're out on

the street who takes the responsibility

and so we have to think of ways in which

we can create these mechanisms as

Citizens and as companies

together um and as a as a conclusion I

mean I think we all agree that the

climate crisis is real and at a certain

point we have to be honest and proactive

as a community instead of like debating

is it good is it bad is it problem is it

solution uh like to work together as to

find ways in which you know there's

always going to be costs but that so

that the benefits outweigh the costs and

in order to make that conclusion we need

the numbers in order to say well you

know this is X this is Y and X is bigger

than y so this is a positive uh solution

thank you for your

attention Sasha thanks very much indeed

really uh useful and insightful for us

here in the amphitheater to have a sense

of the uh negative impact of AI but also

the positive and the message is clear

reflect reimagine uh the relationship
