mean Market competition or the way the

term is commonly used it's intellectual

competition that's what we actually have

to have we can't in fact get into

another Paradigm unless we have

intellectual competition around the

paradigms themselves so that's what I

was really trying to name and again

that's why I think it's really important

to recognize that you've got you know

your sort of pet teal Paradigm your sort

of nrx Paradigm the open AI Paradigm and

then the plurality Paradigm which Taiwan

is the best example of but we haven't

really surfaced that intellectual

competition as of yet and I think that's

what we need to do in order to have

choices thank you so going back to this

idea of competition and

intentionality how can we make sure that

AI um play a key role in addressing some

of the global challenges such as climate

change and um inequality

so okay um just just to to so I'm often

asked how is AI going to do this or how

what's and and I think the framing I I

want to pick up what Daniel asua and

Philip Paul highlight is it's not what

AI is going to do is what we're going to

do with AI and so there's the most

common question from journalists is what

is AI going to do about jobs what's AI

you and I think we have to really take

this intentionality AI is is a tool at

least for now

and um it's becoming more and more

powerful almost by definition the more

powerful the tool is the more power we

have to change the world you know you

can take a spear and throw it against a

cliff and it makes a little Dent maybe

you know you have a machine gun you have

a bomb you have bulldozers the more

power you have the more you can actually

change the world and now we have some of

the most powerful probably the most

powerful Technologies ever which means

that in principle the world could be

very different the depending on how we

use them and that means we have to think
