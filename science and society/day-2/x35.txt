grid which is a computational problem

and requires specialized tools with

presenting that information in a way

that is user

friendly and if you want a chatbot you

want it to present something to you in a

user-friendly way but you don't want it

to solve the problem because it's not

designed to solve the problem and

fundamentally I think we need to think

hard as a

society we need look smart AI tools that

can solve problems and that's not the

same as AI tools that can present those

solutions to us in a userfriendly way so

yes there are some uses of large scale

generative AI but I think that they are

very much on the presentation side and

on the content parsing side not on the

side of actually solving the critical

problems from a technical perspective

that's not what they're designed to

do thank you very much there's another

question I think two seats

down I had a very similar question but I

don't think you answered that question

so I'll ask it again which is so the

elephants are good at

coding no okay but no no no I they can

be they can they can be useful tools in

coding so are they therefore not um and

I'm not saying that you I thought your

argument was very good but if we want to

make lots and lots of bees like millions

of bees all around the world local local

applications Etc we need lots and lots

of people who are able to develop those

bees and they can be supported by the

large language model using a be doesn't

mean that you need to develop it

yourself right like in the case of that

Presto algorithm we built the B so that

the um the the public agencies didn't

have to and they can use it for their

specific

needs it's not really a situation where

everyone builds their own algorithm I'm

certainly not suggesting that I'm more

suggesting that instead of Designing a

GPT for power grids you design something
