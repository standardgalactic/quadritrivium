that's what your carbon footprint is as

an author but it really depends on what

you do and so these kinds of studies are

really really hard and you know you can

argue it either way essentially at the

end of the day so how do we quantify

these changes I've been talking a lot

about you know what what actually um we

need to measure and that's for me that's

the main question where we are right now

we have these impacts they're happening

you know either getting worse or getting

better better depending on who you ask

but I think the the Crux of the matter

is in order to stop debating and stop

kind of having this very wide range of

like on the plot that I showed where

it's like it could be between 6% and 12%

but which one is it right and in order

to answer these questions we need

numbers we need qualitative and

quantitative studies so it can't be just

kind of the the thing that I showed

before where we compare an AI model and

some humans and we make a conclusion no

because that doesn't represent the full

complexity of the matter so we need to

do more life analysis user studies and

interviews in order to really understand

for example if you have time saved using

AI a robot or an app what do you do with

that time and how that differs and you

know what it depends on because

otherwise we're going to be doing

studies that don't reflect the reality

of of of how humans act we need more uh

transparency so U for example um in

December there was a conference at the

International Energy agency here in

Paris um and essentially the conclusion

of two days of very heated debate is

that we just don't know um how much

energy data centers are are consuming

and for example the iea is the literal

Global Authority for gathering this

information and so usually they have all

the answers they can tell you for

electricity they can tell you for

transportation they can tell you

essentially they have almost all the
