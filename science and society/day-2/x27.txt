some examples

but I'm seeing this a lot I'm also

seeing let's integrate llms with sort of

particular things that we like in a

specific use case so maybe this looks

like

this um let's make the elephants more

like bees the bees are

fine so I think that this is this is

where I would like to see where I would

like to see

um transformation in the way in which we

think about how Ai and energy usage in

climate are interrelated thinking about

this not being a tradeoff between we get

the positive impacts or we have these

great applications we can to some extent

have both by being selective and

choosing the right tool for the job

which doesn't mean always no llms but it

means like we don't we we we pick what

we need and so let's go into some more

details here here's an example from my

own group's work on AI for remote

sensing and one of the applications

which motivated us here because we work

with Partners like NASA Harvest and the

European space agencies world serial

program which are responsible for

mapping crops for governments around the

world and if you want to go from

something like this to something like

this which is uh I don't you can't

really see it but this is a a map

produced for the government of Togo so

they could create policies to help

farmers and so it's a map of all the

crops in

Togo and if you want to create that you

need scalable remote sensing

algorithms and so how do you do this

well you don't ask chat

GPT and that's not just because it's big

um it is big and the the agencies that

are using these these algorithms they

don't have anywhere near this amount of

computational power like if they if you

asked them to be running a large

generative AI algorithm they couldn't do

it um and do operating this on the scale
