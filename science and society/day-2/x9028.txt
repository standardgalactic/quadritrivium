hindering Innovation but steering

innovation in a direction that we feel

is not compromising the fundamental

values that are at the core of the

European project excellent thank you um

I I think there's something behind your

question that uh we get asked I get

asked quite a bit uh which is the

competition between countries um and uh

there's this idea that if we low

down because we're you know we want to

be cautious maybe because of uh thinking

that regulation is going to slow us down

um then um other countries are going to

take over and uh I think I think this is

a kind

of misleading thinking we we do have to

take into account that competition there

is competition between corporations

there's competition between countries um

but just like we discussed earlier when

you asked about risks there different

kinds of risks and we can't just pick

one like the malicious use by some other

country against us and that's what every

country can be thinking right um but

there are other risks in which you know

we all in the same boat and uh just like

we've seen in in history before um when

humans who are adversaries realize that

they're sharing you know a common

objective we can we can find Solutions

we can write International treaties we

can find ways to verify these treaties

uh and and that is the only way I think

that we can get out of these very

dangerous

competitions can I can I complement of

what yosha said I think compet of course

maybe we don't need the world to build

uh a a AGI but we need the world all

together to solve uh potential

catastrophic uh risk for uh human beings

this the global you know challenge for

AI safety this is for everyone and I I

don't believe that only one country can

solve the the world problems for AI uh

safety especially uh when it comes to uh

ex existential risks we haven't talked

too much about existential risk and and
