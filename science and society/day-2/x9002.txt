member states that that fill out these

questionnaires give them to the Ia and

they gather the data and they make the

analyses for data centers they don't

have the data because what happens is

that the governments don't have the data

because the private compan is building

the data centers operating the data

centers and um you know the then the

companies that are selling the compute

they will each have part of the data

right so for example Azure or Amazon web

services or whoever will um will lease a

data center from a company that built

the Data Center and they will sell Us

hours of compute and so there's a

company operating the data center and

there's a company that's selling the

compute to users and so essentially all

of this falls through the cracks or

doesn't get um disclosed and at the end

of the day the Ia can't make projections

and they're like guys you guys you have

to give us something because otherwise

we can't do our jobs properly so

transparency is really key part of this

tooling um something that I personally

believe a lot in is kind of bottomup

approaches for for giving people the

tools they need to to do these things so

for example um I helped create a tool

called code carbon which everyone can

use and it works um in par it

essentially runs in parallel to any

piece of code in Python doesn't have to

be AI it could be any kind of code and

we'll measure how much energy that code

is using so CPU GPU Ram what have you

and then based on where the code is

running either locally for example here

in France or in a cloud in Virginia or I

don't know Washington um it will give

you an estimate of the carbon emissions

of that code and also you can use that

to report emissions in a scientific

paper for example which makes my life

easier because then I can track these

emissions when I do my analyses so for

example tools I code carbon which will

give people um and then also what we've
