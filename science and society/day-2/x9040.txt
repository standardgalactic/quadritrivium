may know which is used in moments of

conflict and contestation to engage

people to share their views and their

perspectives on whatever issue has to be

decided but in contrast to the opinion

survey that we've known for decades now

the survey that gives people a box list

of things to check off what they think

think about and comines their thoughts

polus uses natural language processing

people can write whatever they want to

write by way of answer others can

comment and add further language and

then because of natural language

processing it's possible to surface

points of agreement points of synergy

across lines of division in the society

that would not have been would not have

been evident would not have been visible

on the political surface the tool op up

the solution space for public

policymaking and it does so in a way

which Fosters social cohesion social

connection and also confirms the dignity

and value of ordinary people in shaping

the collective intelligence that's going

to steer

Society so in that model that small

example from Taiwan you should have

heard a lot of basic differences from

the first two models the three models

differ on moral

Dimensions they differ on political

Dimensions they differ on economic

dimensions and they differ on social

Dimensions so let me just run through

those four dimensions and explain how

the three models differ and then I will

come to the question of what has

happening in the United

States so with regard to the moral

Dimensions nrx ideology the ideology

behind corporate libertarianism or I

would call it Network Stakes Network

Stak stes in capital

governance that ideology is very

explicit in arguing that humanity is

essentially about a natural aristocracy

there are the talented and the

untalented the theorists of this
