powerful but data centers are growing

but once again we don't see these data

centers similarly to we don't see the

Netflix servers we don't see them and so

we think oh hey the phones are smaller

it's great right great for the

environment we have smaller phones but

actually the data centers are growing

proportionally I I it's hard to get data

on this exactly but I found that um so

the the size of mobile phones has um

like in terms of volume has shrunk by

half in the last decade well the size of

data centers has grown by half in the

last decades and there's also the scale

effects so you know typically we say

well if you have a bigger scale

production you have less environmental

impact you have less waste because you

can buy things in bulk you can make

things in bulk and typically like a lot

of you know uh factories and things like

that will make scale economies and so

the idea is if you had to buy things one

by one and you know go transport them

etc etc it would cost you more it would

be less environmentally um it would be

less efficient whereas if you do things

in bulk it it can it can you know the

the effects per unit of produced are

smaller and so scaling is actually I

mean as machine learning researchers

know is like a core part of machine

learning culture right we want to scale

we want to scale the data we want to

scale the models we want to scale the

compute and so it's interesting because

these kind of these effects that have

been uh documented in economics actually

have a resonance within the AI Community

as

well um and so talking about scaling

laws what's interesting is that we kind

of think that if we keep growing I mean

there's there are blog posts and there

are papers about this saying that if we

keep growing how much data we have if we

keep growing the size of the model the

the performance will be better too right

that's kind of a core premise of all
