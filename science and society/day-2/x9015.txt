methods that currently exist is going to

be sufficient to get the kind of

reasoning that we see in humans

especially the most creative kinds um

but we but we know from other field I

mean other kinds of AI applications like

um alphago that once we introduce

reinforcement learning with enough

exploration then uh sort of creative

streaks uh that go beyond Human

Solutions can can emerge we we're not

there yet but in the last few months

because of the push towards more

autonomy and agency I think the move

from the pre-training large language

models to these agents which I think we

can't really think of them as language

models anymore they are agents they they

learn to act and to achieve goals uh I

think uh changes the perception we

should have of uh AI as we move forward

yeah thank you very much and uh um

Professor s uh of course we don't know

everything yet but um what is your um

your opinion regarding the what we don't

know what are the capabilities we don't

know about the most advanced AI model at

the moment yeah that's a very very good

question I would say what we know is

very little actually we there's a lot

that we do not know uh and I say in

essentially almost every aspect uh of

the AI capabilities we have huge open

questions I mean so one just first in

terms of how we can how the uh

capabilities are improved as y I

mentioned so earlier there was a lot of

focus on pre-training scaling for

pre-training and then more recently

there's a scaling on INF time and also

with the recent deep SE and so on now

there's also uh essential what we have

seen is earlier the inflence time

scaling still like it was expensive but

now there's evidence showing that that

also can be done much more cheaply so so

that's in one dimension is in terms of

how the capabilities are improved we we

don't there's a lot that we don't know

and then the other aspect also Yasha
