it's about how to think about how to map

out ai's indirect environmental

impacts so maybe some of you have seen

movies about this or read articles but

the butterfly effect is an actual I mean

theory is an actual uh observation that

um happens when a small when small

initial changes in complex systems can

result in significantly different and

often unpredictable outcomes in the

broader land keep over time so this is

really interesting um if you think about

it and it's been um observed in

everything from meteorology so you know

the flap of a butterfly wings in the in

the hurricane but also physics and

biology so this is definitely something

that that happens in complex systems

right in societies a complex system and

a lot of AI models can be considered as

complex systems as they interact as they

fit within existing tools within

existing uh existing um paradigms in our

in our society and this is why I think

that uh thinking about the butterfly

butterfly effects of I um can be a good

way of thinking about how small changes

how small ways in which we we we

implement we deploy our systems can have

far-reaching impacts in

society and so my field of study

particularly is AI in the environment

and um anecdotally um so I started out

um I did a PhD in AI this was kind of

slightly before the the big deep

learning Revolution and I went to work

in in applied Ai and I spent a couple of

years working on really interesting

problems and and with a lot less compute

might I add uh one of the one of my

favorite things that I worked on was for

example um chat Bots that you could talk

to in your car uh that would reply to

questions about the manual like how do I

change the oil how do I you know what

side is the is the fuel tank on and you

know they were running on tiny tiny

chips and we were doing really cool

stuff and then at some point I had what

I call my um my quarter life crisis and
