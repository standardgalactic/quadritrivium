in the conversations I've been having

with my colleagues at hugging face with

colleagues at um at at conferences I

feel like these are themes that keep

coming coming up and people sometimes

use different words for them but it's

actually like something that's a that's

that sometimes you're having a

conversation you're like well we just

talked about this you know a couple of

days ago but in completely different

context so let's start oh yeah and and

they I'm not I haven't come up with

these myself the lots of critical

Scholars have already came up with these

um in in the past so starting with

representativity what's interesting when

you think to the origins of AI to the '

50s

1956 AI really functions on on the basis

that data is representative right you

take a data set and you want to solve a

task you're like this data represents

the task that I want to solve it

represents the reality of the context

and there's this myth I call it a myth

uh of generalizability so if you get as

much data as possible from the internet

and without consent you can use that

that model that data to train a model

that will be general purpose that will

be a general purpose technology and the

more data you have the more the higher

your chances are of creating truly

general purpose

Foundation models right and this myth

persists and actually what you think

about it and this came came to me when I

was listening to a talk about AI bias

when we talk about bias we talk about

the fact that the model is making flawed

assumptions about the reality of the

world based on flawed data on on data

that doesn't generalize to the world so

for example um there's a really um uh

iconic uh propublica report about the

fact that AI is used in the criminal

justice system system in the US and that

race is disproportionately used in order

to predict essentially the the potential
