ultimately these human plus machine

systems will create more value but also

by keeping humans in Loop continue to

have us have a level of power which I

think is all the the thing I said I was

most worried about that we need to have

a way that we have some of that economic

and ultimately political

power so I will bring us back to

political institutions again I mean

we're watching a tech coup in the US um

as folks know where concentrated tech

power is really also acquiring power

over our core political institutions now

I've offered several critiques of this

today I want to say though there's one

thing that is right about what's

happening which is that it flows from a

recog recognition that our political

institutions have been failing that they

have not in fact been serving Society

well now I have a very different vision

of what it means to serve Society well

than somebody like Elon Musk does

nonetheless I think it is true that we

can use technological affordances to

reimagine political institutions in in

support of democracy so collective

intelligence social uh dialogue social

listening all of these things can be

embedded in our political institutions

and achieve a greater degree of

responsiveness flexibility openness

accountability and transparency than

we've had reconnect our institutions to

the people so that we are actually

steering for the good of society and

again can crack through that alienation

and frustration and that that is a Tech

Challenge a tech puzzle Tech can help

solve and address those problems the

last thing I'll say is that in addition

to being excited about the power of AI

we should be excited about our human

power and to that end I mean I 100%

agree um yosua with your point about

decentralized um steering for super

intelligence should it emerge and so

perhaps we should also give ourselves

the social technical challenge of how do
