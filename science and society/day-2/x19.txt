this is something that we are really

working very hard on and we're using uh

different llms I mean we have been using

Gemini GPT Lama and now also we start to

use lips so we really try to H do the

cross comparison of performance among

all the models

and um this is something that we also

talked about when there was the this was

in nature climate change when when there

was the discussion about the moratorium

for POS in AI our view there that that

was a commentary piece was that one

should not stop technology development

because at the end of the day the

solution to a lot of the regulatory

problems will also come from from

technology itself from development of AI

itself so it should not be about

stopping it should be about improving

regulation it should be about engaging

public and private sectors and together

really pushing forward uh in terms of AI

as one solution to the environmental

problem and this is also one last um

piece of work that we are doing um we

have the SG agenda up to 2030 there is

also the planetary boundaries which is

put together by the Stockholm resilience

Center and the planetary boundaries are

basically a bunch of um measurable

quantities that should not be passed

through certain thresholds to ensure

prosperity in the planet we are

unfortunately quite in the red in

several of those planetary boundaries

what we want to do H with with J AI is

to H obtain a Consolidated agenda

incorporating the SGS and the planetary

boundaries so the more uh environmental

aspects in the planetary boundaries the

more societal the more economical in

such a way that we can have a

streamlined um yeah Consolidated agenda

Beyond 2030 to take into account all

these things there's a lot of synergies

and trade-offs between both agendas so

that's the type of stuff that we want to

really identify in an unbiased and

objective
