the number of Roads if you can come up

with such a model then not only you can

predict the consumption you can also

predict its Dynamics and then you can

anticipate and create coordinated

actions to have a better impact on on

the SD that you're trying to tackle so

interpretability is key and uh I want to

also highlight before I finish a couple

of things that we're working on now with

llms so what we are doing now and this

is together with the UN and with Google

research is basically trying to identify

synergies and tradeoffs within the SGS

and this is done that has been done this

is something that has been done by

experts many times but we're interested

in the hidden connections I mean there

are obvious connections between the SGS

if you affect the amount of water

because you want to preserve certain

species in life underwater you might

have a negative impact on SG one and two

for instance so there are obvious

connections but I'm interested in the

hidden ones H because those hidden

connections is what's going to allow you

to eventually and I can show you a

little bit of what we're doing um make

optimal policy decisions if I want to

optimize the achievement of sdg13 I need

to First H

connect the S the all the documents all

the policy all the projects all the

research articles with sdgs I want to

create this Matrix of positive and

negative synergies and trade-offs and I

want to eventually through optimization

create optimal policy decisions right so

we are at the stage of being able to

establish those synergies and trade-offs

efficiently and this is work that we

have under review in nature currently

these are some results that we obtain so

you can see synergies and trade-offs

among all the SGS again if I want to

optimize I want to have the the global

picture if I want to invest in sg-13 I

want to see that there are going to be

negative effects on on the society so
