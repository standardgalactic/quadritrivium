there is no point in attempting uh for

me to say this is precisely what

regulatory instrument we should um we

should uh put in place in our countries

our role as legal Scholars are to is to

inform policy makers and lawmakers on

what is legally feasible that is to say

what are the options on the table what

are the foreseeable consequences of each

option what lessons can be learned from

the past and what are the criteria one

should take into consideration when

choosing a regulatory

instrument that is why the purpose of my

research is to build a regulatory uh

toolbox this is something used in other

sectors like telecommunications for

example where public authorities have a

wide variety of power at their disposal

so that they can conduct targeted

targeted and temporary interventions

depending on the context and on market

dynamics that allows for a very more

flexible approach to regulation and this

is more compatible with a fast Pac paced

environment like artificial intelligence

so the regulatory options range from

supply side so-called technology push

measures that aims at encouraging the

adoption and the integration of

sustainable practices into the AI design

to demand side so Market pool measures

which goal is to empower AI users and

buyer to take sustainability criteria in

their their choices so examples of uh

technology push measures involves for

example the use of environment ex an

environmental impact assessment for the

biggest model

um sustainability by Design requirements

that do do not have to be imposed by the

government but they can also be defined

by the actors themselves um and uh

through voluntary codes of conduct or

Norm voluntary adherance to Norms for

example also incentive to open source uh

uh AI which um encourage the

mutualization of compute capacity which

is something that we want um an example

of um demand side measures include um
