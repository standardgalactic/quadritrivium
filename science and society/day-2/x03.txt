features many interacting agents with

conflicting interests you have the AI

providers data centers company energy

providers um grid operators governments

citizens users for example each of them

have conflicting interests and also

conflicting interest dep depending on

where they are on the globe the second

characteristics that the a market

feature is fundamental

uncertainty because you are

fundamentaly on the Dynamics of

innovation for example you can't

forecast the adoption right rate of AI

the You can predict the scalability of

the solution you can forecast the

technology iCal developments as the

field is EV evolving so fast the third

characteristic is that the existing

governance

infrastructures have a very limited

Effectiveness in addressing such uh

problems such environmental problems and

think of the ineffectively of

international environmental law for

example from which Donald Trump just uh

withdrew and finally all of these

aspects are also interdependent and

interact which other which add to the to

the uncertainty over this um this uh

problem um so basically information is

lacking um expected values are not

reliable and Dynamics are continuously

changing that makes all traditional

instruments to inform policy making

completely inefficient like cost benefit

analysis because we don't have expected

value that are that are reliable but at

the same time as the e economy is path

dependent as I told you a less Fair

approach could lead us to geize our

capacity to live a world where

technology is compatible with planetary

limits to Future Generations so we can't

do nothing um on at the same time then

we need to find a way to co-regulate

with Market actors to find a sustainable

path toward uh in AI

considering the the the wicked nature of

the AI and unsustainability problem
