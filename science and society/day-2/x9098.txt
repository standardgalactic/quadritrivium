in the US Trump and musk being very

vocal

on very different topics and AI being

one of them uh obviously France and uh

and Europe also with the submit have

very strong ambition in China we had

deep seek so yosua how do you think that

uh that will impact the next

decade well that's a case where I think

we need

intentionality uh because the default is

we're going to have two countries

leading by far um this race

towards human level Ai and even I uh

super intelligence systems in the future

and I don't think that is a good thing

for the planet it's not thing good thing

for for the people on the on this planet

um I I I would like to see oh and and on

the other hand I think if you look at an

individual country like France or

Germany or the UK or even you know uh

countries that are less developed um

it's not clear how they can bridge that

Gap right now um but um there are

several reasons why I think it would be

good if we saw a third alternative that

would be better aligned with the kind of

uh uh humanist values that we find for

example in Europe and democratic values

and the protection of the public um the

you know the sort of things that you

mentioned that that mean that you know

people uh don't get super stressed

because they lose their job well that's

everywhere

um and I think it could also play a

positive role with respect to the the

race that is engaged between the US and

China if um if a few countries with that

who have collect the talent the capital

the energy to uh to compete but but one

to build AI responsibly uh in a way

that's going to benefit people in in a

in a intentional way I think uh can

really change that future and U maybe

bring a bit of uh uh counterbalance to

the direction that we're seeing right

now which uh concerns me

so I I think the other thing that's hard
