same amount of coal we should be using

less coal but what jeans in the 19th

century uh 1860 I think it was observed

was actually that we're using more coal

because we're using uh for example

engines to go further people are

traveling more with with the coal and

it's it's kind of a it's the Javin

Paradox how is it and it's been um also

observed with energy it's also been been

observed with you know a fuel efficiency

the fact is that our cars are getting

more efficient but we're going further

instead of going I don't know to the

countryside 50 kilometers away for a

weekend as we would have gone I don't

know 10 20 30 years ago now we're going

to another city just because we can

because you know with the same amount of

money you can go further and so

essentially what we're seeing in AI is

that Hardware efficiency is objectively

improving the gpus are objectively

getting faster but Nvidia is shipping

more and more of them every here it's

selling more of them so like how do you

explain this Paradox right this JB's

Paradox of AI and also Umar apart from

the the direct rebound effects there's

also economy-wide rebound effects which

are really interesting because as

opposed to like talking about the same

um unit so like coal or compute or

energy it's it's really kind of a more

of a ripple effect and there's all sorts

of different uh indirect economic

effects that can be um described and

what's interesting is that this has

actually already been talked about in

the in the I mean by multiple authors

but specifically around foundation

models which have um the potential to

impact the whole economy like there's

actually a paper it's a bit confusing to

read sometimes it's called gpts or gpts

and the essentially it's a paper that

says general General pre uh generative

pre-trained Transformers which is you

know GPT chat GPT that's the acronym are

general purpose Technologies so gpts are
