basically using incomplete contracts

like I learned in Philip's class um you

know I won't say how many decades ago a

lot of many decades ago um and um in

order to do that um we ultimately I'm

gonna have to rewrite the law

significantly and I know I've spoken to

some US senators who are interested in

in rewriting the laws to take advantage

of this but um you know your question is

one that's becoming more and more

relevant the only other thing I'll say

is in addition to the laws there's also

a number of companies like uh Prada and

others that are developing platforms to

keep track of how the content is used

and um give a mechanism for licensing

revenues to flow to the

creators thank you so I'm sorry if we're

running a bit late but I have a last

question on a topic that I think is

really important and has not been

addressed yet on the past two days uh I

think it's a real Democratic Challenge

and AI Challenge and it's about

recommendation systems because they are

like everywhere on social medias and

they're becoming a uh a very important

ways people used to inform themselves

and uh and they're completely controlled

by big tech companies and they're really

opaque uh on a technological level and

on a political level and so I was

wondering what are your opinions on the

challenges of recommendation systems and

how how AI can be helpful or harmful in

addressing these

challenges well you're right to name

that as a considerable problem and so I

think there are a lot of experiments

underway for alternative um algorithms

but also I think um transparency

standards and so in that regard figuring

out how to help build Civil Society

third party actors who do have access to

the relevant um you know compute and so

forth capacities that they need in order

to do auditing as a part of it um so

again it's it comes back to the theme of

power right that is we can't really
