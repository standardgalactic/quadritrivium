independent of Economic and political

interests on the intersection between Ai

and people both individually but also as

a society and that's why I think we need

a lot more research on this it is very

difficult to do this research

particularly on the impact side and I

think Sasha St is an example where she

says we have no numbers because there is

no transparency um so it's very very

difficult to do the research mostly

because we are talking about extremely

large scale systems potentially deployed

um all over the world being used by

billions of people and also because the

commercial um deployments of these

systems of course are proprietary and

they're closed and it's impossible to

really understand what's going on but

this doesn't mean that we shouldn't and

that's why we really need to um Advocate

and we really need to invest in ways to

do research not only to um anticipate

measure and assess the risks but also to

understand the societal and the

environmental impact of the system so to

me that would that should be if I was

the Prime Minister of a country or uh I

would definitely um focus that as a

priority so excellent so weed we started

talking about the the solution about

International collaboration um Professor

s if we look at the risk management and

governance of AI um you you would say

that what are the the most promising

approaches at the moment where we are at

the moment what are the most Prov

providing approaches yeah thank you

that's a very good question uh so yeah

so recently we uh with the number of

leading uh researchers we actually

launched a a a proposal called a path

for Science and evidence-based a policy

and uh uh with this this proposal

essentially we talk about that air

policy should be science evidence-based

and we in particular need to prioritize

to advance the scientific understanding

of AI risks and how we can successfully

identify and mitigate them uh and yosua
