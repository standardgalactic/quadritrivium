is a very important danger which can be

uh you know increasing the all the other

risks um so uh how do we deal with that

I I think uh at the end of the day it

has to be through some kind of um uh

meaningful multilateral governance

International uh uh coordination um

because we don't want a single person a

single Corporation or a single country

to have uh super powerful AI systems

that they could use you know for their

own advantage or even to make mistakes

that you know they they they didn't see

coming uh that could cost us all and um

well all participating to this AI

science and Society days so Nora you are

director of the Elis

Alicante it's the Spanish herb of the of

the Elis European Network NOA what do

you think about the the areas that we

need where we need more research

regarding all these topic we have

mentioned thank you so I wanted to

completely first before answer your

question completely emphasize the last

point that Joshua made in terms of the

um unprecedented accumulation of power

in the hands of a few and this is just a

tip of the iceberg uh I think this is

extremely dangerous to happen in any

discipline but particularly in AI

because as we've been talking it's a

transversal discipline that is impacting

you know every sector everywhere and um

partly uh in response to that we

actually as a Grassroots Movement we

created Ellis in Europe which is the

European laboratory for Learning and

intelligence systems with the idea of

having a distributed scientific network

of Excellence of the best Minds you know

working in AI in Europe in a

Distributive fashion as a sort of like

counterweight to this accumulation of

power um in terms of the El UN in

alikante that you asked me about it has

the name of the Institute of humanity

Centric Ai and um it is the response of

um my personal worry on the fact that

there isn't enough independent research
