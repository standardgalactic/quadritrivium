are also different economic and social

paradigms and they have different

answers to the question of how we will

make these social decisions so there is

a paradigm that says maybe we'll just

have a benevolent dictator I think you

sort of honestly I think that's sort of

what open AI is kind of drifting along

in those streams and my view would be

you know no like you know we shouldn't

just sort of say maybe it'll be that way

we have a choice we can work do the

social work do the relational work do

the policy work to steer technology and

develop paradigms that are supportive of

human flourishing but that's again why

the title of my talk was it's time to

choose because it's not about seeing the

future it's about actually choosing the

future can I add something to this

sorry uh I completely agree um and I

would like to add something connected to

some of the things you said

um influencing the future so that we we

go to a world where AI is a tool and is

used for the benefit of all and that all

the the productivity gains are

redistributed is not going to happen

just you know by Les letting the forces

of markets and competition between

countries do their like usual work uh

because competition right now what it's

doing is um going to the easiest jobs to

replace for example maybe the people who

are like less well off are not going to

be easy to find another job um the

competition is going to making AIS more

capable and not safer and not acting

more morally um competition is is making

countries compete on AI and start to use

it for military applications in and and

maybe cut corners on on safety and other

risks so I think that uh we can

construct a a a better world with AI but

it has to be intentional and not just

let things go can I just clar clarify

for one moment thank you for saying that

because it um it's really an important

point and I need to clarify what I meant

by competition because I didn't in fact
