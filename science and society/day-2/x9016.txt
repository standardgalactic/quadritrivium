mentions this agentic aspect I think

that's a huge unknown uh and I do

believe that actually we are moving to

the next Frontier which is agents and

actually I'm teaching a Muk massive open

online course on large language model

agents we Tau the last semester with

over 15,000 enroll and given its a huge

success we actually have um a new

version this semester uh called Advanced

large language model agents that

actually particularly focus on reasoning

planning and also coding agents web

agents and also AF math and so on so

that's another big unknown and then the

third one I would say is actually the

things that we don't even know that we

don't know so essentially these models

often we call it like there these

capabilities like how do we elicit its

capabilities there a lot that we don't

know that these models can do we right

now don't have the right method to

elicit these capabilities and some of

these capabilities are dangerous

capabilities that we don't even know

right now what's the right way or what's

the best way to elicit them and makes it

even harder for us to understand these

uh a systems

capabilities thank you very much for for

this very interesting answer and um uh

it's very also interesting to see that

as as we don't know all these AI

capabilities at the moment it it also

mean that we do not have an exhaustive

vision of the risk associated with this

advanc AI model right so I had I had a

question for all of you anyone that want

to to answer um what are the uh so you

were mentioning Joshua in your

presentation uh a number of risk what

are the risk that are that seems to be

for you the most striking one the the

most important one and what is the

likelihood of this risk and uh their

severity so I mean really if we you had

to speak about only one risk each of you

let's say uh what what would what would

it be
