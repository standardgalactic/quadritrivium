something at least in Belgium something

like 60

to 120 houses connected uh to one what

is called DSO uh so this is like one uh

community so consumers were only

rewarded for useful green energy meaning

that the energy was uh being used

locally um if you don't have solar

panels well then you can buy this green

energy and that was through a kind of

virtual coin which we called Energy coin

yeah um so you can only buy green energy

with energy coins when green energy is

available yeah but that um gave the

right incentives for people to only put

green energy on the grid when it is

expected to be uh used by consumers and

consumers would also shift their

consuming uh patterns to when the energy

is being

available this energy coin is something

that was traded for euros on a global

market and this is how the different

local markets could be connected to make

sure that the prices of green energy

were equal amongst the different uh

communities

um we did then also simulations so

that's in a nutshell and the main

properties of the incentive uh

mechanism um and what we then also did

is to yeah how can we now validate this

this incentive mechanism then we did

multi-agent simulations so that means

that we are

simulating prototypical households uh so

you can get prototypical households by

looking at the real data and and doing a

kind of of

clustering and then to compose all kinds

of possible communities and see how well

the incentive

mechanism was performing and we compared

it to that's the chart you see on the

left hand side we compared it to other

uh trading mechanisms and uh we saw that

uh it was much more efficient in terms

of energy uh trading um and uh what you

see at the right hand side is of course

you have to run simulations in in in a
