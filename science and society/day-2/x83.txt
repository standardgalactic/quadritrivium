talk about bias when you talk about

fairness when you talk about access to

technology well sustainability and

ethics are often linked because uh

they're two sides of the same coin you

know if a if a a system is so expensive

that um only a few people can have

access can afford access to an AI model

for example often that comes with like

huge amounts of compute and so

environmental impacts and so essentially

this paper is also about that how can um

societal and economic impacts actually

impact the environment as well so let's

start with material rebound effects and

maybe these are the ones that are more

the most tangible for kind of people

when when they think about uh AI or

technology in general so for example sub

substitution right nowadays more and

more we're replacing material physical

objects by digital ones and that's

really interesting because that means on

the one hand you know whatever Netflix

has replaced DVDs right and so you don't

have the material objects anymore and so

you tend to forget that even digital

objects have an impact on systems on the

environment Etc so just because we don't

have the DVDs you know piling up in our

living room doesn't mean that there's no

impacts to to be taken into account and

same thing with AI that we've had we

have ai systems that have partially

replaced dictionaries right how many

people actually like will carry around

or have a dictionary at home

encyclopedias and Maps who even uses

Maps anymore right Pirates and people in

mountains and but otherwise we don't use

we use AI for navigation right and so

there's this really physical material

substitution that's happened that is is

hard to quantify there's also space

rebound effects these are the rebound

effects that changes how physical space

is used so for example mobile phones are

shrinking right does anyone remember

phones from like a decade ago uh no our

phones are smaller they're more power
