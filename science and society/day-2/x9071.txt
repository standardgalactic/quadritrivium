the clock here I'm running down so I'm

just going to say that right now the

government has its thumb on the scale

steering us towards replacing workers

with machines and the way it does that

one of the many ways it does that is it

taxes machines

less than humans so if you've got um two

workers whoops if you got two workers

one of whom has a thousand workers and

uh uh two entrepreneurs one with a

thousand workers and one with a thousand

machines the government says that the

one with a thousand machines will pay

lower taxes and so it's steering people

towards replacing humans I'm not sure

that's the best thing if you want to

have widely shared Prosperity not just

Prosperity so there's there's a a bias

there and there are a number of biases

built

in let me just uh wrap up by looking a

little bit to the far future and this is

something I'd love to talk about in the

panel as well uh if you go to a deep

mind they have a modest little slogan on

the wall there Demis hasab says the goal

is to solve intelligence and then use

that to solve all the other problems in

the world I'm sure each of you has a

mission statement either in your company

or or personally that's equally

ambitious um but um there's some truth

to it if you could solve intelligence

you could solve these many other

problems and we are now having some very

powerful technologies that are beginning

to really affect things far beyond what

we saw in the call center or the coding

or the earlier examples that we saw um

some of these technologies that are

emerging currently and that are likely

to be emerging the next two to five to

10 years are likely to affect much

broader sections of uh cognitive work

and ultimately physical work so we had a

gathering um uh uh last year at aamar in

California of about uh 50 economists and

about 50 uh technologists to talk about

this thing we're calling transformative
