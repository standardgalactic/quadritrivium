much the same actually it's worse in

France France had uh even lower

productivity recently than it did

earlier so what's going on how can we

explain this well one explanation is

that we're not measuring digital Goods

very well um we've had an explosion of

digital Goods um we have you know

LinkedIn and Gmail and YouTube and Skype

and all these things of course we've got

open AI Gemini anthropic Cloud all these

tools um uh uh and we're having a lot of

these ways of looking at the um world

all through this digital lens virtual

reality I have a quest uh VR headset

that I use every morning

um but these digital Goods that humans

are now spending uh Americans are now

spending about 8 and a half hours per

day consuming these digital Goods they

tend not to show up in our official GDP

statistics GDP measures all the things

that are bought and sold in the economy

but with few exceptions if something has

zero price it has zero weight in the GDP

statistics so most of these Goods don't

show up and in fact if you look at the

official US data uh since all these

goods were invented look at the far

right uh GDP in the information sector

which includes all these digital Goods

hasn't changed at all it was a little

bit below 5% uh 30 years ago and it's

still around 5% so we're not seeing it

that doesn't mean it's not creating

value it's just that it's not measured

in official GDP so we do have a

measurement problem and that translates

into productivity because what's the

definition of

productivity output divided by input how

do we measure output GDP how do we

measure input ours worked so if we don't

count digital Goods in GDP we're not

going to count digital Goods in

productivity either we're missing all of

that and folks especially my friends in

Silicon Valley say hey that's a big

problem we're not counting the benefits

the way we should be and I think there's
