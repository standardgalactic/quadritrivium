earn well more than you know somebody

with a CO I don't know somebody in in in

Cairo or uh in in I don't know Malaysia

can pay right because the the

concentration of wealth is also becoming

quite apparent and also the digital

divide in AI is increasing like when you

when you talk to people from the UN they

talk about digital divide as something

that has been present for for decades

now like with this the plot for example

the figure is is is how many cell phones

per 100 people uh populations have and

so for example North America Europe Etc

have almost 100 cell phones for 100

people but that number uh goes down as

you go to continents like Africa and

Asia and you know okay cell phones are

not necessarily proxy for AI but it

helps to have some kind of device when

you want to talk to chat GPT right and

so the the digital divide in AI is is

also growing and for example if you want

the latest and greatest you need the

newest cell phone if you want Apple

intelligence you need iPhone 16 and and

plus right that means that this is this

is creating a gap with people who can

afford that and people who can't and so

um and yet when we talk about AI systems

we don't talk about Justice and power we

we don't talk about benefit right we

talk about for example fairness

representativity or or carbon footprint

and so uh going back to this paper uh we

we wrote with G and and Meredith about

bigger isn't always better and uh it was

this really fun paper to read Because in

terms of money in terms of environmental

cost in terms of Ethics that they're all

actually linked and uh we we showed this

by the fact that um the financial

Capital required to participate in

Cutting Edge state of theart State

state-of-the-art AI research is

increasing significantly now it's

becoming more and more uh expensive just

to practice AI um because of gpus

because of of the time required and also

the cost of inference as well is rising
