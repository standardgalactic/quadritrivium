purpose tools creates and put that

capacity in the hands of the people for

the sake of steering Society in the

direction of human flourishing right

that's the political Dimension the

economic Dimension is you also I think

have probably heard by now the first

model um continues to double down on the

accumul of capital by a rarified few and

then linking that Capital with power and

without much concern for questions of

safety net Social Services welfare or

the like the second model effective

altruism model continues to marry the

capital accumulation strategy with a

welfare picture so in that regard again

hangs over more from the mid 20th

century paradigms and the third model

focuses on the question of how do we

build an economy that integrates

everybody in productivity in the first

instance that is about for example human

complimenting AI instead of human

replacing AI how can we expand the kinds

of work we human beings can do for each

other with each other and for human

flourishing not diminish what we do not

shrink it into merely the projects of

the capitalist technocrats right right

so integrating people in the economy by

using tools to expand what human beings

are able to do by complimenting our own

distinctive strengths now in the social

domain last Point here um again you

should have heard already across the

registers in the first model the nrx uh

libertarian corporate model or network

State plus Capital control model there

is very little concern for social

cohesion there is in a sense an

expectation of cast societies a

separation of those who are naturally

Superior from everybody else um in the

effective altruism case that's also a

very segmented and segregated social

picture in the third case the third case

the plurality case the focus is on the

fact that as human societies pluralism

is a benefit to us diversity is a

benefit to us when we can generate
