Simo we we worked out with Simo and

several members we had a fantastic

commission and in fact the commission

was co-president of the of this

commission was an Buro who organizes the

the whole Summit uh with the uh the

delegate of the Pres French president

for the whole Summit we had main

reporter aril Sim bunel and c and what I

will talk about today is very much based

on joint work with Simo who is here

first

uh so as you know I mean I don't need to

to remind you that AI first develop in

the form of deductive rules of the type

if something then something that's what

we called the so symbolic approach based

on reasoning and INR instructions but

although the symbolic approach has not

been abandoned a statistical approach to

AI has been gaining ground since the

1990s machine learning unlike the

symbolic approach the statistical

approach involves no explicit human

instruction the machine is trained to

recognize links from a set of training

data and the Machine then applies these

links to new data to perform a task uh

the success of the statistical approach

relies on two essential inputs data and

computing power uh uh the revolution is

truly as Eric stressed it's a true

general purpose technology it's a true

technological revolution in the same way

that steam engine electricity and it we

revolutions it affect all domains of

activities the economy Public Services

the organization of work media culture

and within that Revolution the emergence

of generative AI represent an

unprecedented acceleration to just give

you an idea it took two and a half years

for Netflix to reach 1 million users it

took only five days for chat GPT to

reach 1 million users okay so now there

is as was stressed by explained by Eric

there is a pessimistic view my friend

Daron and others maybe Gord Bob Gordon

were very good friends they have a very

pessimistic view of things and uh they
