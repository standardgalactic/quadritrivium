very Amplified in the public

when uh the um conversation about AI

safety was having is that we've had the

same kind of uh conversation when the

internet Bloom was happening uh the

dangers of cyber security dangers of uh

market monopolization so where have we

failed in mitigating the risks of

Internet so we expect not to succeed in

mitigating the RIS the risks of AI well

that's a great question I think one

problem is that that at some point in

the 90s uh a few governments decided

that we should leave software

unregulated and just you know try it out

and see what happens um s to you know go

fast and break

things well um because of the kinds of

risks that we've been documenting in the

report I think we can't afford that um

we have to be more cautious we have to

um make sure that the actors who create

products or systems that harm people

that cause you know death or loss of

property can be sued and they will

behave better yeah thank you very much
