it's maybe not strong enough so that was

a research Gap that we identified at the

time and if you look on the left H the

biggest research Gap is on the economy

so the positive effects of AI you can

see it actually over here that I'm

reducing from this light color to this

dark one over here the positive effects

of AI on the economy have also not been

sufficiently investigated right there is

evidence but it's not strong enough

that's another research Gap that we

identified at the time so this is

important with and and the timing is

actually interesting with all the

discussion that we have about

productivity and loss of jobs and so on

so really those positive effects need to

be investigated in further

detail let's look at some examples and

again I'm going to give some high level

examples just not to uh spend 3 hours

going to the through the 169 Targets in

the Excel you can see all the details

overall overall the positive effects are

through new technologies that are enable

enabled through AI so one example of

this would be on sg1 on no poverty so

for example this is work done at

Stanford quite some years ago nine years

ago I think where they did was to really

use satellite images analyze them

through a computer vision tools to

identify regions of poverty right so

this this is a clear example of how AI

enables to do something that really can

have a positive impact in terms of sd1

and the negatives are typically through

increased inequalities or unequal access

to the technology so a typical example

would be on sg10 on reduce inequalities

where if the future heavily relies on AI

as it appears to be the the case and not

everybody has the same type of access to

AI then we're going to exacerbate

existing inequalities and obviously have

a quite negative effect on sdg 10 on

reduce inequalities so I would say that

being a bit generic because there's a

lot of nuances but the positives are
