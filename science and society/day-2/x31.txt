considering accuracy maybe want to

consider did it violate

physics or how computationally costly is

this not necessarily from an energy

consumption perspective but also from a

user perspective like the user might

want something that's that's more

scalable but this depends upon the

particular the particular setting and

then to solve these problems you also

have to build in domain knowledge

you have to integrate whatever knowledge

you have with the particular problem

often times these really big AI

algorithms they work less well because

they're not actually taking into account

the structure of remote sensing data or

something like that because they're

trying to have a one-size fitsole

approach and often times a one-size fito

approach means that you don't fit any of

the problems or at least you don't fit

them really

well so and then the the final way in

which I want to to to beat this this

this question over the head with lots of

lots of different counter arguments um

the the the final thing I want to say

is this is a mischaracterization of of

tradeoffs also because it's really not

just energy use that's making climate

change worse from if you think of all

the different ways that AI is is

affecting the climate it's not just like

AI has positive applications and uses a

lot of energy AI is also strongly

affecting the climate in negative ways

in addition to positive ones AI is used

in fossil fuel exploration and

extraction um to give up to a 5%

production boost estimated half a

trillion dollars in additional profit

for the industry

already AI is hugely changing

consumption patterns because basically

all online advertising relies on AI now

and this is not always linked to

increased consumption but it is in areas

like Fast fashion fashion is the third

biggest contributor to climate change
