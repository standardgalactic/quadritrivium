produced um do you think this is why big

Tech um geam why they allowed it to

pass and they're lobbying

and um it's way more complex than that

because it's a huge and complex text so

we can't say that this is because it's

only a documentation obligation on the

sustainability uh question that this is

why the text uh passed but uh uh of

course uh doing something more stringent

W would have led to um more opposition

from technology companies uh if they

because it it gives them more um

generate more compliance Cod and and so

on so obviously uh having something more

stringent would have raised more

opposition and to be honest in in the

process of the legislative process the

European Parliament version was very

more stringent on um on on environmental

regulation and it faced so much uh

opposition that it has been watered down

throughout the process uh but it is a

democratic process uh with a certain

influence from the private sectors so
