like to call up uh Yoshua uh Benjo now

Yoshua is a computer scientist from the

be entitled The International report on

Yoshua wrote that uh report um and he

will discuss it unpack some of the

details of that with a number of key

speakers we'll be welcoming uh Dawn song

uh professor in computer science at UC

Berkeley uh Yen uh professor of brain

inspired Ai and AI governance there'll

also be Nua Olivier director of research

advisor i e fellow um and all of that

will be moderated essentially by gam

AI France so uh once again once Joshua

has Yoshua rather has done his keynote

speech we'll get stuck into the round

table welcome to Joshua good to have you
