included high risks from the perspective

of environmental costs I would love to

see that I would love to see a way that

environmental costs for an AI system are

being captured as one of the things that

you can uh use to assess how good that

AI system is how how much we want to

prioritize

it because all applications of AI can be

shaped with climate change in mind and

not just because not just by making the

algorithm smaller by thinking about how

we're using those

algorithms so takeaways

computation AI is sometimes useful but

in climate relevant applications and

really across societal societally

beneficial applications it's only useful

sometimes if we're thinking about our

managerie of different AI algorithms we

don't always want to be using the big

generative AI systems um from an impact

perspective as well as from an energy

perspective AI can be designed for

problem specific goals that's very much

for the computer scientists in the room

if we are building new AI systems we

don't just want to build general purpose

systems those can be useful sometimes

but thinking in terms of Designing for

user needs it actually leads to a lot of

interesting Innovations in AI as well as

a lot of impactful

Innovations and then finally all

applications of AI can be thought of

with climate change in mind AI for good

isn't just about adding new good

applications if you're interested in

more resources on this I would point you

to um all the the resources that we have

at climate change AI we have reports

designed for the policy audience as well

as for the research audience and ways to

connect with an International Community

of folks at this intersection of AI and

climate change coming from lots of

different fields and lots of different

uh sectors and perspectives we also have

events the next one will be coming up

for uh a more AI academic audience at uh
