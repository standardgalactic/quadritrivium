industry so everyone have the same

interest in controlling each other and

Advance nuclear safety this interest

alignment it is not the case with AI

where we have a lot of competing

interest the third lesson come from the

successive environmental laws and

Emissions cap in the automobile sector

for example it showed us that

environmental regul regulations can be

built gradually can be responsive to

Scientific evidence and consensus so

experimentality and graduality are

important characteristics of a good

regulation and finally we can learn a

lot on the consequences of deregulation

from the experience of the financial

sector thei financial sector has been

marked by cycles of Regulation no

regulation in the 20th century very

strict regulation after the TW the 1929

crisis then deregulations in the '90s

after the end of the Cold War which

eventually led to the 2008 SubCom crisis

after which we saw the reemergence of

Prudential regulation that we know as of

today so in Market characterized by

systemic risks deregulation seems to

lead to to crisis and the AI Market is a

market with systemic risk because AI can

be used in a wide variety of application

and basically across all uh sectors so

all of this has to do with AI and

sustainability it starts to be common

knowledge that AI companies should take

environmental costs into to account you

may have seen um charts like like that

this is a modelization done by Schneider

Electric uh which modelize different

scenarios of electricity use by AI the

truth is you can uh find dozens of such

simulation no one is reliable but they

uh at least give an idea of the tendency

we also have our own problem with data

centers and even in France with example

in Marseilles with data centers that um

led to problems in terms of

monopolization of drinkable resources

biodiversity harm because it used um

cooling techniques called River Cooling
