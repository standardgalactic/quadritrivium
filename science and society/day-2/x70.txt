business

and individual alike where AI is both a

source of new solution and also of

unprecedented

risks and finally let me mention AI

efficiency it's a key issue if we are to

develop AI while reducing the

consumption of resources that we know

are

fite and finally AI reliability which

confronts Earth to the mysteries of AI

as a black box and this has in well this

means that we we need to really work on

explainability understanding the

rational behind and things like that

which are very complex in all these

areas and many others research

especially fundamental research has a

vital role to play and sometimes often I

believe Solutions will emerge from

places we least expect

it's typical for research this is why we

must maintain our commitment to an

ambitious AI

research AI is an extraordinary almost

Limitless field of research and you are

all the proof of that but if we must

tackle the AI Revolution it's also

because doing so is absolutely essential

to remain at the Forefront in other

scientific domains

this is what AI for science really means

as you well know AI acts now as an

accelerator of scientific discovery in

many many fields do I have to remind you

that the last that at the last Nobel

Prize ceremony AI was everywhere far

beyond its traditional role in

mathematics let me mention a couple of

applications in healthc care its impact

is undeniable

this past Tuesday February the 4th

marked World concert day and I can tell

you that researchers for example at

Gustav rusi Institute a global leader in

cancer research are increasingly relying

on AI and their progress is making real
