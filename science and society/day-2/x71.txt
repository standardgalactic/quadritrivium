prediction is a major breakthrough

enhancing our understanding of

biological process

and leading to better Diagnostic and

treatments in chemistry AI is driving

discoveries of new materials and

molecules in climate science AI plays an

increasing role in predicting and

understanding the impact of climate

change and by coupling traditional

numerical models with learning in

astronomy and some of you might know my

deep attachment to space science AI

helps identifying ke key elements within

the vast noise of the cosmos and finally

AI is even transforming fields we do not

immediately associate with

it in fact AI is not only reshaping

science it's redefining what is possible

today just this week a papy scw burned

during the eruption of the mount vus

2,000 years ago was deifer thanks to a

combination of X-rays and Aid driven

analysis it's just an amazing and

incredible

moment please forgive me I I will just

take another example well which is

perhaps very French example but let me

take for example the notam the Pari

example if you have not visited notam

yet as rebuilt I I well it's not too far

away from from here and I strongly

advise you to to to to take a couple of

hours to do that notr Dam's restoration

was an extraordinary Collective effort

and the result is magnificent but for us

researchers it was perhaps above all an

unprecedented scientific Endeavor and AI

was again

everywhere Vision language models have

helped to identify architectural

elements to enable an identical

reconstruction if I take a step further

away from the so-called heart science in

archal research conversational AI really

helps scholars in

navigating vast amount of historical

data in archaeology AI has improved

geospatial analysis helping in the
