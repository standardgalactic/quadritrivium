safeguards and so on with that code

easily it can easily be taken away

either by removing lines of code or by

fine-tuning the model to get rid of

these defenses um so that it makes it

easier for uh malicious actors to use

these systems and uh when these systems

become sufficiently capable to become

weaponized I think this becomes an issue

that we have to deal with

um on the mitigations I won't say a lot

because I unfortunately there's not

enough research on mitigation um there

are risk management techniques that

companies and researchers have come

about but they all have limitations um I

think there's some promising directions

but we need a lot more research there um

one other thing I want to say that is

important from uh you know the point of

view of uh policy makers is that the

uncertainty that I've been talking about

about those risks about which scenarios

or which um uh outcomes will happen uh

makes it difficult for policy makers to

uh you know be certain that they're

going to take the right decision um if

um they uh try to mitigate the risks uh

and it turns out that you know those bad

things don't happen um it might uh be

seen later as unnecessary on the other

hand if they wake wait for stronger

evidence uh it could leave soci Society

unprepared uh for major risks so these

are hard decisions that that are really

in the realm of

policy

um I will just go to the conclusion here

um

again the science is clear there's a lot

of evidence about these risks uh those

that are happening now those for which

we have Clues we have um you know coming

signs as I I I I outlined and that means

the AI could be extremely useful it

could be very beneficial in fact you

know the this whole Summit is going to

be mostly about the benefits but in

order to reap those benefits we need to

understand better those risks and we
