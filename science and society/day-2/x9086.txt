there is no we don't believe that in the

short and medium term there is an

AI will generate Mass on employment you

mentioned Eric steam engine you remember

when there was the steam engine

you have some countri they do very well

on Pisa test show good Piza test sh good

set scores have a good education system

and on top of that you put a good labor

market policy training program and the
