data is that when you can see it was

turned on um you could see that the uh

time to handle calls improved quite a

bit and so you see the the this is a uh

difference and differences model and you

can see there's you know there's no

question there is an improvement there

this is not one of those ones where you

have to do fancy econometrics is very

simple to see um sometimes the system

broke though and you know bad news for

the company bad news for the agents but

great news for me as an economist

because I got to see what happened when

the system suddenly went down and I was

worried here also I was worried that the

agents would become dependent on the

system and would forget how to answer

questions and they would lose the

knowledge kind of like when I'm using a

GPS sometimes I don't remember how I got

somewhere because I'm just paying

attention to the

machine we did not find that um it's a

little bit noisy because we didn't have

quite as much data the system was up a

lot more than it was down but when it

was down I think it's fair to say you

could see that even when the system was

not working the agents who had access to

it did better so this is the agents who

had been using the system and suddenly

lost access to it they continued to

outperform the agents who didn't have

access to the system so they had learned

something the system was not just a tool

for answering the questions it also

turned out to be a tool for teaching

them and having them learn the correct

answers and we interviewed the people to

understand this better and what was

going on with interesting before they

had the llm the agents would we meet

with their manager about once per week

and the manager would call them into the

office for about 15 minutes look at the

transcript and say oh you know here here

you could have mentioned this other

product it would have been better for

them oh you know here maybe you
