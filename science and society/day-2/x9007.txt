synthesis of um the uh work on risks uh

regarding the most advanced AI systems

and this is what we've done

um the uh countries that were there at

blle Park uh got together um and uh

created a panel uh of Representatives

experts from from these countries also

the panel includes representatives of

the EU the UN and the

oecd this is um the first time actually

that such an International report uh

inspired by the ipcc but with a um a an

apolitical uh structure which is really

independent of the pressures that

governments may put on but really

focusing on the science and the evidence

that can then be used to inform policy

makers um this is U an you know a large

scale effort with about 100 AI experts

from around the world um who don't all

agree with each other as you know there

are lots of debates about AI but we can

agree to disagree when that's appro

in fact it is a very important

information for policy makers to know

where um scientists agree and disagree

so the three main questions that are

discussed in the report are first about

capabilities what is it that these

Advanced AI systems which we call

general purpose because they can do so

many things they're trained on so much

data they um know uh for example you

know in the case of the large language

models uh 200 languages in many cases so

that's very broad knowledge and um the

report looks at the evolution of the

capabilities of these systems across

different areas the benchmarks that

exist in the scientific Community the

second part of the report of course

which is the heart of it is the risks uh

what are the risks uh we we have chosen

to organize them in a particular way

that I'll describe in a few minutes um

and then then the third part uh you know

maybe more on the positive side is what

can we do about it at least at a

scientific level so the report again

doesn't make any political
