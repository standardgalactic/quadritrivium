shouldn't swear so much you should be a

more polite you know and and go through

the transcript and give them some advice

now that helped a little bit but you

imagine once a week 15 minutes it's it's

fairly sparse they don't learn that much

with the a with the llm the agent were

learning continuously every time there

was a question they weren't quite sure

the answer the llm was giving them

saying here's a good way to answer that

here's another good way and they had to

think okay yeah that works this one

doesn't work so it was real time on the

spot customized uh uh learning that they

were doing and that's why they learned

so much

faster here's what I think was one of

the most interesting results um when we

broke the system uh down and we looked

at different agents those who are the

most skilled versus those who are the

least skill those who have been doing

very well versus not doing well there's

a very clear monotonic uh effect there

the bottom 20% had the biggest gains

about 35% Improvement the next group

also had big gains all the way down to

the very best that the top

20% it looks like zero it's not really

distinguishable from zero so the best

agents really got no benefit from the

system and the worst agents got the

biggest benefit um this is striking

because it's very different from what

economists recognized in most of the

earlier Technologies for most of the

past 20 30 years what we've seen is what

economists call skill biased technical

change that is that the technology has

been helping the most skilled workers

and not helping the less skilled workers

and it's been helping more educated

workers and as a result technology has

increased wage inequality and income

inequality that's not what we're seeing

here we're seeing the opposite that the

technology is actually helping the less

skilled workers more than the more

skilled workers again we tried to probe
