will do worse donon asoglu is a much

more pessimistic take I'm going to go

this a little bit quickly because I want

to get to some of the other material um

but he makes a different set of

estimates um although he uh uh so for

instance he he starts with a smaller

share of occupations that he assumes are

affected uses different thresholds and

then he says that even if an occupation

is affected you may still not um

actually implement the automation there

um so he multiplies those two number you

get only

4.8% being affected and then he also has

a lower estimate for how big the

productivity gain he says

15.4% and so when you multiply those two

numbers together you get something

almost 1/10th as big is what what we had

uh about 71% over the entire decade or a

tenth of that uh per year so that's a

much smaller number um to my view he's

being very pessimistic on all of his

assumptions but his paper goes in much

more detail and you can see how he does

that and then I mentioned the agon

Brunell uh paper which I think is is the

best one so far it's much more

comprehensive um and um I won't take you

through all of it but they one of the

things that they do well is they have a

broad range of literature and they about

many of the different numbers there and

so there are some low-end estimates of

as little as 18.5% some high as

68% um and there are ranges for each of

the other numbers as well um of course

that leads to a wide range of estimates

um from something that's very small to

something large they have a preferred

estimate of about 68% per year and uh uh

Philipe can correct me if I if I did got

that wrong but that's the last yes he's

nodding his head okay so that's what

they sell um and this is um about 10 10

times more than Deron has it's more

similar to what um our paper was or the

nationaly um also it's similar to what

the french AI commission does and then I
