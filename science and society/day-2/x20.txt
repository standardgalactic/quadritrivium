way and that's all I have for today h

these are some of my conclusions at the

end of the day our main idea is to

really redefine the future agendas for

sustainability and help make optimal

policy decisions uh using Ai and using

generative methods I'll be happy to take

your questions

okay thank you very much Ricardo nice so

we have time for some

questions okay question here microphone

is

arriving here we have question

okay thank you very much for the very

useful lecture you referred very much to

your article 2020 but you know AI is

moving extremely quickly so um in a

sense uh what you said today was it

strictly based on your article 2020 or

as it Incorporated recent developments

which some of them have been really

spectacular yeah that's an excellent

point the quantitative data is from 2020

so the actual numbers but the discussion

and the conclusions I mean is taking

into account current developments and I

mean of course some things need to be

fine-tuned but most of the conclusions

still hold today

yes we have a question here again

thank you for the talk really

interesting I was wondering to what

extent you include the magnitude of the

effect in the study because uh the graph

seems to show the number of targets it

could help but you could imagine that

having a dramatically negative effect on

one target would actually outweigh the

benefit of small benefits on a dozen

others so the Big Green area may be bit

misleading in that way yeah that's an

excellent point and that's what

motivated what we are doing now with

with LMS basically and and other

optimization methods so it's not so much

of a purely a literature survey of what

could be the effects but rather a detal

to for policy development that's what we

are trying to do so with this technology

that we have now H we can then quantify
