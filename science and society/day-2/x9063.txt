you have more input no increase in

output well that's a decrease in

productivity so you get the downward

part of the J curve later you start

harvesting all those intangibles you're

like now we have some new products new

processes now we have a skilled

Workforce that can do new things and

when we combine it with the technology

we can create even more output than we

did before so that's the upward part of

the J curve

so this is a very common pattern we

documented it in my paper about the

productivity J curve that's mentioned

there at the bottom um for uh software

we documented it for electricity we

documented it for other goods and

services and we believe that's now

happening for AI in fact we think we're

near the bottom of the J curve and it's

beginning to take off right now so we're

going to see we think um a big increase

in productivity over the coming decade

as we Harvest some of the Investments

That companies to begin to make now of

course to be clear it's not always so

clean that there's a single start and

end these are overlapping J curves but

the net effect is the same that you tend

to underestimate productivity at first

and then you get big Harvest uh later on

so what are some of the possible

productivity Futures so there's a lot of

different productivity futures um that

we can consider um but let me uh use one

simple uh theorem that we can use it's

halton's theorem and it's actually

theorem is almost too fancy a word it's

more like holton's uh multiplication is

you just take you multiply the areas

that are affected by the technology by

the size of the effect and if you

multiply those two numbers you get a

first order estimate of how big the

effect is on the economy so many people

have done this uh uh Martin Bailey and

Anton corck and I did it in a very

simple little paper for Brookings uh the

nationaly that report that I mentioned
