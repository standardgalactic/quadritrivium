increase the alpha when you automate the

production of ideas you increase the ga

and both are important so let me start

first uh I will just go back and mention

your paper uh Eric that you uh Eric

looked at this firm at this Fortune 500

company in the US which advises uh small

and mediumsized Enterprise on Enterprise

software so you have the smmes and the

head of an you know makes a call to this

Fortune 500 company and said look you

know we want to adopt a a you know

software and you are sent to employees I

don't know if it's in the Philippine

wherever and the Philippine employees or

wherever it is and they some of them

most of them they use not to have access

to uh llm and then you give them you

provide them access with llm

progressively so you can compare the

product ity measured by the number of

resolutions per hour you can compare the

productivity of an employee who has

access to llm to a productivity of

someone who doesn't have access and my

way of representing what you do is

particular this uh so the the you

compare to an employee who didn't of

similar productivity education and

background who hasn't had access to llm

the employee which is who is given

access and productivity is boosted plus

14% after one month and plus 25%

compared to the uh control group

employee so boosting effect and that's

what you your paper show that in for

this Enterprise to adopt AI to introduce

Ai and generative AI had a boosting

effect on productivity now that's one

Enterprise and then you want to go you

say okay that's a micro study what

happens when you move from micro to

macro so one way is to say let's

extrapolate from previous general

purpose Technologies from previous

Revolution electricity for example uh

increased even after a period where you

didn't see anything suddenly you had a

takeoff of growth and it increased

growth by 1.3 points I mean if you
