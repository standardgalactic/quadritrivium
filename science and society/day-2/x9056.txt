and understand better what was going on

what seems to be going on is that this

is a new technology that is able to

capture a lot of tacit knowledge in a

way that earlier Technologies didn't

when I first started writing AI systems

in the 1980s I did it with expert

systems and we wrote rules and you had

to really know exactly what the answer

was and you would write it code for it

and then the system would spit that back

out with the llm it actually learns on

its own from many examples of inputs and

outputs what the right pattern is this

set of inputs goes to this set of

outputs and the way it learns is looks

at the best answers and where does it

get the best answers from it gets the

best answers from the best agents so the

best agents were training the system

disproportionately and then when the

system learned how to give good answers

it was giving them back to all the

agents well of course the best agents

were just getting back a lot of the

answers they had already implicitly been

using so the best agents didn't get much

of a benefit or really no benefit that

we saw the worst agents however they got

the biggest benefit so it turned out to

be a real leveler capturing this tacit

knowledge that's all through

organizations I think this is one of the

biggest economic benefits of these

Technologies of machine learning more

broadly is that it's able to capture a

lot of implicit tacit knowledge that

humans previously not been able to

express uh David otter calls this palan

Paradox this idea that all of us know

more than we can tell I know how to ride

a bike but I couldn't write down

instructions for you to ride a bike I

know how to tie my shoe I know how to

recognize my mother's face these are

easy for us to do but they're very hard

for us to express machine learning

overcomes palan's Paradox or at least

helps with it by capturing a lot of

tacit knowledge and this is unlocking
