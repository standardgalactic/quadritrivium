system seeks to replace the structure of

nation states with a structure of

corporate States that's the most radical

change that we see and it reflects the

fact that in this moment in contrast of

the age of electrification in the age of

electrification electrification gave

States incredible new capacity that made

planning possible now in the age of

general purpose AI again there's an

incredible increase of

capacity but differently this time

there's a fight over who is going to own

that capacity will it be States or will

it be

corporations so that's what we're really

watching unfold in the US right now that

fight over whether not States or

corporations States steered by people or

corporations steered by capitalists

which is going to own the new capacity

that has been produced by general

purpose

AI then you've got in the with regard to

the second Paradigm what's the political

picture there with Alman that is a more

conventional acceptance of having the uh

new capacities in fact stay in the hands

of States but with immense power in the

hands of Corporation to steer those

States so no attempt to rest the state

from the people no complete attempt to

do that but certainly a vision of EX

extreme corporate influence on the

activities of the state now the third

version you can tell where I'm going

already the plurality digital democracy

version that is a picture of politics

which affirms the value of democracy and

continues consistently to put State

capacity to put the capacity generated

by general purpose AI in the hands of

the people we need more concrete models

of that Taiwan is the best model that we

have but this is really a call to all of

us I said this is a time for choos using

to select that last Model and to think

about what does it what different tools

do we develop if what we're trying to do

is to take the capacity that general
