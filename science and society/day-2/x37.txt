write cool but I know they are very

inefficient but I think they are very

efficient partly because of the hardware

we are using now to run them or llms are

pro they are using a very efficient

Hardware so what is your view over the

evolution of Hardware are we expecting

some breakthrough or Improvement that

may help to solve the problem so I'm not

a hardware expert I would I would pass

that question maybe along to to Sasha to

talk about it in in her talk um but I I

I think that the again I think that the

bulk of the savings is going to come

from thinking about what kinds of

algorithms we want to use where and what

are the best tools for the job in

situations where we do want llms to be

helping with with writing which is

they're very useful tools in certain

cases I think that there are ways to

make algorithms more effective efficient

and and Hardware more efficient but

again I wouldn't look to that as being

the primary savings because most of the

savings I think comes from having fewer

elephants not from making the elephants

smaller or yeah you know I don't know

what the hard the the metaphor how the

metapher works with Hardware Sasha I'll

hand it over to you thank you very much

thank you thank you

[Applause]

again okay but uh before Sasha we have

um an noi an no is a full is a full

professor of computer science at the r

University in Brussels where she had the

AI lab her main research interest is

reinforcement

learning including multi-agent

reinforcement learning and multicriteria

reinforcement learning she strongly

believe in the interplay between Theory

and application so her team developed

novel algor

which were test in domains such as smart

grid communication networks megatronics

and sheding problems so the FL is

[Music]

your okay so um Al so very happy to be
