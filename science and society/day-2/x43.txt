the confidence was getting too low it

would just say I cannot solve

problem um and then the user friendly uh

interface and that connects uh to also

to the previous talk I was mentioning

and there was a kind of syntactic sugar

that was used at the time so the

interface looked like natural language

like but of course it was not a very

Advanced way of communicating with the

system as a user you're still had to to

know quite well uh which format you

could use and here and this llms uh but

then small ones for a specific domain uh

could be useful yeah uh in the Black Box

you also see what was called an expert

system shell uh so there were

standard uh architectures uh in which

you could feed the rules and then you

had your expert system for a specific

domain a bit later because getting

information or or Knowledge from an

expert I can be rather tedious it is an

effort you have to do um there was this

uh second generation of uh expert

systems and that was already allowing uh

machine learning to come in in the sense

that if um you would present a case to

an expert system and the conclusion

would be I don't know how to solve the

problem you could enter extra rules or

it could also uh learn new rules or

generaliz from uh existing rules so uh I

mentioned repairing a car so if you

would have a problem with uh the right

light uh in your car at front or the

left one well uh your car is symmetrical

or or mainly uh it wouldn't matter

whether it's left or right so you could

generalize the rules uh things like this

so people were gradually uh including uh

machine learning but mainly symbolic

ways of uh doing uh machine

learning and this is a bit the movements

we have seen a in AI I don't claim these

are exact Figures it's just to give you

uh an

impression um so we see a very big

dominance of symbolic AI up till the 80s

where the new networks and the simple
