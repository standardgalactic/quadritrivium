different applications and tools so it's

going to be the the the Butterfly

Effects if you will um um will be

cumulative um so as a conclusion um we

don't have a good picture of uh ai's

Butterfly Effects and I was very

frustrated when we were writing that

paper because there's no numbers there's

almost no numbers and it's really hard

to get any data um but as a community I

I really believe that we should reflect

and reimagine also the relationship with

AI Technologies business objectives and

ecological imperatives to better reflect

our values and Kate Crawford who's one

of the co-authors on this study is

really good at at formuling this she

wrote the discussion if you read that

paper she wrote the discussion because

essentially it's a it's a it's a matter

of finding compromises finding ways of

balancing out you know the triple bottom

line or whatever you want to call it but

essentially finding a balance between

sure you know corporations profits Etc

but also ecological imperatives also

citizen rights etc etc and like what can

we really converge upon that will work

both for profit and for for example the

planet um also I think we I mean this is

something that I've been convinced of

since I began began my academic career

we need interdisciplinary approaches no

single um discipline no single kind of

communities going to have all the

answers and you know that means we need

life cycle assessment uh methodologies

integrated maybe with machine learning

tools integrated with socio you know

soot technical anthropological research

because because like as I showed you

there's societal material and um and

economic impacts well that means that

you need to work together between

multiple disciplines to get a better

idea of them right and so I mean I I

kept falling through the cracks as a

researcher because I kept on like

insisting that I wanted to do

multidisciplinary things and you know
