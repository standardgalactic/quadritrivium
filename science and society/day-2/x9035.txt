we living through right now with the age

of AI and what ethical questions are on

the table for

us what I want to suggest is that right

now we have moved beyond the point of

speculation and Beyond the point of

hypotheticals with regard to thinking

about how general purpose AI

Technologies transform human

life we have also moved beyond the point

as I said where safety is enough to

think

about because of the general purpose

nature of AI Technologies they are as

you know working their way through every

single sector of society the whole of

the economy the whole of society the

whole of political institutions we're

living through an age that I take to be

roughly equivalent to the age of

electrification there's the time before

electricity and the time after the time

of the horse and buggy and then the time

of the

automobile and that time gave us

completely different ways of organizing

both the economy and politics in the

world in the wake of the age of

electrification the globe saw an

increase in state capacity the ability

of states to set policy to steer the L

lives of their people and throughout the

course of the 20th century we had a

profound argument between two different

paradigms for how States might deploy

that capacity in the wake of the Great

Depression we had the rise of Keynesian

approaches to economics Social

Democratic approaches where State

capacity public sector dollars were put

to work stimulating economies building

social safety nets putting an ethic of

solid ity at the center of

policym yet that approach to the

muscular deployment of Public Power also

resulted in excessive regulation a

stifling of innovation stagflation and

the like and so that Keynesian moment

Was Then followed by what we have come

to call the neoliberal period in
