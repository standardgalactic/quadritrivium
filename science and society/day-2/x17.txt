and the transparency when implementing

this apps that can be key and this is a

good example for what happened with

technology so this is another study

where we talk about these things in data

driven methods for

health and I want to also highlight this

um this interactions right between the

technology the society and the

governments in this diagram the thicker

arrows indicate faster change and we can

see clearly and this is something that

we are seeing even again this was done 5

years ago right but with llms and DEC CI

this is even more true right I mean the

technology goes very fast in creating

new new needs for the individuals the

individuals lack behind the technology

and the governments are way behind in

terms of Regulation need for standards

need for really being able to catch up

with what's happening from the

technology point of view so this

interplay between these three agents is

really key

uh if we want to really understand

what's happening and what's going to

happen in the in the months to come I

guess the time scale that we're talking

about is not years anymore is

months um this is something that we also

wrote some time ago about

interpretability in nature machine

intelligence so we really highlighted

the need to develop interpretable models

if you want to impact uh the SGS

positively going back to the example of

the computer vision to analyze satellite

patterns to detect poverty um if you

develop an interpretable model and

there's quite some work now now on um

inductive biases and symbolic rotation

to try to come up with equations that

can reproduce the performance of the

models then if you can instead of having

a black box you have an equation that

predicts the per capita consumption in

terms of amount of light in the night in

the pictures in terms of distance to the

road to a main city in terms in terms of
