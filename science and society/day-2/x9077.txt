percentage point if you are growing at

1% per year for 10 years you grow at 2.3

and then you go back to 1% for it it was

a boost of

0.8% per year percentage point if you

are growing at 1% then for 10 years you

grow at 1.8 and then you go back to one

okay so that's what you have here okay

so so without and suppose AI would be

anything between uh it and electricity

you would have this kind this shape

without AI the evolution of GDP would be

the dotted line with AI for 10 years you

grow faster you have a steeper slope and

then you get back to the slope that you

had before okay that's the if you

extrapolate or the extrapolation we say

if AI of anything between it and

electricity we should see in the onor

magnitude at least 0.7

0.8% you know percentage Point

additional per for 10 years so then the

other approach is the as glue approach

and the the Tas based model and so what

they do is said when you know gains in

total Factor productivity will depend

due to AI will depend first on the GDP

share of task that are exposed to AI

then of course among those task the only

a fraction it will be profitable to

implement AI then it depends on the

labor share on those task and the labor

saving which is induced by Ai and on

these all of these numbers asog put some

figures and he arrives at a

0.07% addition percentage Point per year

10 times less than the extrapolation so

what we did with Simo is to go back to

the ASO glue we said we take the same

methodology but let's go back to the

numbers and for the GDP share of task it

takes this number from elu but you know

for example IMF believes that instead of

98% it's 68% so you have the whole range

uh you know share of tax that are

exposed to Ai and muglu is on the

pessimistic side if we look now among

those task those we would be profitable

to adopt you see what happens is that

aogl uses a paper that says we know you
