effect direct environmental impacts

energy has become a very very big

talking point and and and point of study

and discussion in in terms of AI in the

environment So currently this is

estimated that demand from data centers

is around 2% but this is a this is an

estimate because we don't have the exact

numbers um but it's also projected to

more than double in the next two years

now by 202

um and that might not seem like a lot

but you know it's it's more than most

small countries right if you think about

you think about globally uh energy use

water once again Gathering a lot of um

worry a lot of traction because data

center is the way they're built I don't

know if you've ever visited a data

center but I strongly recommend it going

if you can um they're huge they get

super hot and you need constant water to

cool them and this water part of it

evaporates part of it can be cooled down

and reused but it has to come from

somewhere and us usually fresh water

because uh it won't corrode the system

if you use salt water it can you know

create kind of crystals and stuff like

that so it's usually pretty pure water

and it has to come from somewhere and

you know with growing data centers we

need lots of water and that put puts

stress on our rivers and we know that

you know fresh water is limited also

Rare Earth minerals um once again for

every you know physical thing that runs

an AI model whether it's a phone a GPU

uh computer what have you that needs

metal that needs all sorts of actually

different Metals you know we think of

about aluminum but there's all sorts of

different like Cobalt and geranium Etc

and all of these have to be mined they

have to be transformed and that has

environmental impacts as well like the

amount of Earth you have to move in

order to get one gram of copper one gram

of cobalt is actually really

significant also um we have greenhouse
