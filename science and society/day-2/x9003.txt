heard is that companies have been

integrating this tool inside their own

internal dashboards or whatever

corporate slang they use in order to

give their employees more information

about their in-house tools because as

more and more people use AI inh house

we're going to need to have have these

um these this data come from somewhere

and also you can make choices so for

example one of the first things that I

did when I joined Huggy face was I asked

to switch the compute from us East which

is actually the most um it's it's in a

place it's in Virginia in the US and

it's called Data Center alley because

something like 60% of data centers are

in this like one region and it's kind of

like where there's the most compute and

so but it's it's mostly natural gas and

so it's not very environmentally

friendly and so I asked Huggy face to

switch from uh Virginia to Us West or in

Oregon that has hydro electricity so

things like this that you know if you

have the numbers if you have the data

you can make informed choices and of

course regulation I think that um both

laws and taxes are can incentivize the

usage of more efficient tools and

systems like of course carbon taxes

exist but figuring out what exact

mechanisms are necessary because the

thing is with rebound effects and

indirect impacts is that they can be

like essentially jeevan's Paradox the

solution or the way to fix jeevan's

paradox is regulation is for example uh

putting a tax on carbon that's one way

of of slowing down this this effect and

so I think with AI as well we're going

to have to create laws that will

incentivize kind of more sustainable

usage of AI Technologies because

otherwise the the paradoxes and the

Ripple effects are going to keep

multiplying and especially since the

technolog is it's not just a car it's

not just a a steam engine it's something

that can you know be used in multiple
