this is a question that I need to answer

now there have been many other studies

I'm not going to go through all of them

but we find very similar patterns in

coding and writing and management um and

in each of those uh the results actually

were strikingly similar you often got

double digit gains 20 30 50%

productivity gains often within just a

few months and in in the first three

sets of studies we also saw this pattern

where the less skill workers benefited

more than the more skill workers it

seemed to be a tool for helping spread

the knowledge from the best to the rest

the last study is a relatively new study

and I just added it to this slide um in

science uh Aiden Tona Rogers he's a uh

just a secondy year student at MIT did

this terrific study a randomized control

study of scientists looking at Material

Science and here you got very large

productivity gains so that was the good

news but interestingly um it was the

best scientist who benefited the most

and the scientists who previously hadn't

been doing as well didn't get as much of

a benefit so there seemed to be sort of

more of a a spreading out of the

performance um in this particular case

and it's interesting to think about why

you're in one category versus the other

maybe if somebody wants to ask about

that in the panel we can dive in a

little bit more deeply on that

particular question but I'm looking at

the clock so I'm going to push ahead on

some of the other

results so I could show more micro

studies and I think they do show that

progress has been going very fast my

Silicon Valley friends tell me that

progress has never been faster I think

they're probably right um but on the

other hand uh we haven't seen big

economy-wide gains um so here's my

friend Bob Gordon he and I sometimes

have uh debates at at Ted and elsewhere

um he's uh he's a great Economist and

he's kind of a skeptic about the
