efficient um maybe also interesting to

to mention typically um card name and

and Minsky or like the most well known

people in in Ai and less associated with

AI is CLO Shannon because we know him

from information Theory but it's no

coincidence uh that uh one of the large

language models is actually called Cloe

but uh you can I will not go into that

connection uh here here in in this talk

but he did play also an important role

in large language

models so how did people think back then

uh to Ai and the the idea was we have

some problem in the real world um we

want to map it into a

representation that can be understood by

a computer we can do inference we can

come to New conclusions and then back uh

map back these inclusions to the real

world um and it's no uh surprise or it

was no coincidence that uh the first

successes were like in board games

because unlike chess because uh if you

have a situation of a board game it's

easy to

translate the situation of the board

game into some some

representation that can then be

processed by a machine so there is no

doubt uh how the bo looks like there's

no discussion on this we can encode it

and after this encoding we can think

about what are all the possible next

moves that's also easy uh to describe

and and uh to deal with in a computer

and then this typically leads to uh what

we call a search tree and a search tree

is really something fundamental if you

think about uh a I uh problems so it

basically gives you all the possible

moves you can do of course it doesn't

tell you which move is a good one that's

where the AI comes in that's why the

search why um um how the search comes in

and there's different ways to deal with

this we can do juristic search or uh we

can even use re reinforcement learning

and to learn us what is a good way and

to SE in this three for uh the the next
