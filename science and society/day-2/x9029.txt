how to get prepared U but just bear in

mind that maybe we're going to have AGI

pretty much very soon but can you solve

the problem for existential risk uh

within 10 years maybe not so later it's

too late we'll have to just one quick

I think what has happened is that we

true general purpose AI is is AI is too

but it's very different compared to a GI

um but still we need to get prepared for

both General P purpose Ai and also

potential high level unpredictabilities

thank you very much to the four of you

maybe uh so we we we wanted to have a

short Q&A session before you go uh so is

it possible I mean it's an excellent

opportunity for you all to ask all the

question you have about AI safety to

expert in the field

so please do not

hesitate and I think there is a system

of a question um us think the app on

smartphone I don't know if it's working

or not or are we just sharing the

microphone

uh okay okay perfect perfect just two

question that we have one question here

yeah

student actually okay

okay the are you sharing the question

or okay we we have one question here in

the in the room I will give my

microphone this so yosua in particular

the um the precautionary principle is

all very well you're driving in

mountainous terrain and it's foggy and

you might fall off a cliff

but um that only applies if you're not

carrying say a transplant heart to a

patient who's otherwise going to die and
