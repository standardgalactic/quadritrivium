optimize on the use of scale resources

and uh there is still research in

progress to assess the the relative

importance you see that we know that

there are various areas for example

Water Management where AI has had very

very positive effect reduces waste

enormously but the thing is to quantify

that research is slow uh the problem is

that you know you can do as fast as you

know so what we do in the report is to

acknowledge the important you know Ai

and social dialogue Ai and education AI

but there the research needs to be done

and and research is slow already that we

could do with Simo and you look already

a bit at the growth and and employment

imp already in we did that short period

That's we I I never thought we would do

that it's not that those topics are not

important that research takes time

that's the thing but we I believe it's

hugely important particularly

environment and AI I think that's a

hugely important topic and I work on

green and I work on AI I haven't worked

yet on the intersection but that's

that's on the research agenda thank you

very much thank

you okay uh as a next question it will

be around having a world built on I so

um one of the thing that people fear

today is that it's not possible

currently to check that your data your

own data is not used inside uh training

data and so how do you think we can

protect Creations from being part of

training set without the offer consent

and do you think that authorship

persists if a generated creation is

inspired by an existing work so this is

a increasingly important question and I

can't speak to the laws in other

countries but the United States I know

that there's a lot of confusion um

companies are worried about using llms

because they're unsure whether or not

they're infringing on different

copyrights and uh you know now uh

ironically uh open AI is suing deep seek
