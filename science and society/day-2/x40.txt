uh move we should play but once we

decided on this move we can link it back

and execute it in the real world sorry

I'm and this is a surprisingly uh very

general Paradigm so I already mentioned

like medicine well we can also model

knowledge of medicine into something

like a search

so if you come and see a doctor you um

you tell the doctor which symptoms you

have what is your problem and then the

the doctor will actually search

in this big search tree for what

possibly causes the problem but also how

your problem can be

treated so here you see very small part

of such a surgery and actually what you

see on the slide is one of the most

famous

textbook um uh expert systems called

mying so it is based on rules like this

so these rules encode knowledge of

medical

doctors um and uh by connecting the

different rules where one antecedent

becomes the conclusion of the other one

you actually get uh such a search tree

also important is that you see um the

number 0.4

because not everything in medicine is

unlike uh the chess game uh is is

something which holds for sure and

there's also some uncertainty that we

can deal with so these reasoning methods

also took these uh uncertainties uh into

account and um then the rules were also

um translated into a more human

understandable format um this is still

syntactic sugar and that also connects

to uh the previous talk but I will come

back to that a bit later so you can

argue of course for a computer scientist

we can as well read the rule uh in in a

kind of lisp like uh style uh but

there's a kind of translation that we

can do uh to make it more human readable

and this is uh what you see

below so

this is all about uh human uh

knowledge um but we can also deal with
