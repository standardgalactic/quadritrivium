things like who who are large language

models benefiting Who's the who are the

people training them who are the people

using them right and um and how and how

the the carbon footprint of this field

of specifically especially in large

language models it's text right how the

how that that's been rising with regards

to computer vision which has been rising

probably less less significantly so

essentially this has been kind of like

the discussion in in in my circles

anyway um and last year I decided um

actually no two years ago 2023 um I

decided to broaden the scope a bit

because um someone came up to me and

they're like well you guys keep focusing

on this tiny little bit of the problem

but what about the life cycle what about

the life cycle of AI and that really

kept me up at night because I was like

well what do you mean life cycle of AI

because if you're talking about life

cycle of a pair of jeans or a t-shirt

then you can really do Cradle to the

Grave right how the cotton is picked how

the threads are made how the the cotton

fabric is is is is woven then you have

the actual manufacturing process etc etc

then the wear then the disposal like

it's it's more concrete but how about a

life cycle of an AI model and so

essentially we tried to do this in the

paper uh about the bloom Lang large

language model and for some of the steps

we just don't have any any any numbers

so what what is what is the end of life

of an AI model right that's more of a a

metaphysical question maybe to

philosopher friends but uh we focused on

equipment manufacturing model training

and model deployment and that was

already uh two steps Beyond beond what

most studies focused on before which was

mostly only training and what we found

is that if we consider these other steps

we can estimate that the carbon

footprint of Bloom the model we were

looking at actually doubled so any kind

of numbers that we had before the ones I
