I was challenging yosha like I think

we've been talking about risks for large

language models a lot but we haven't

talked about the risks of rule based

reasoning the risk of braining by the AI

and Roso was like oh that might be

because of my own bias that uh I'm

mostly focusing on Lang language model

and then to me I was like that's not a

good answer and I cannot be convinced

for that for that but when you see the

later versions of the report it says

we're going to focus on General purpose

Ai and that actually convinced me

because rule based the reasoning now

they're not doing general purpose Ai and

for brain inspired AI not so much

inspired AI system now actually focus on

general purpose AI but I think this is

still something that maybe we we can

make a change for the next versions is

that there could be unpredict

unpredictabilities when you know rule

based reason are combined with large

language models with self reflexive

reasoning uh that might come to a even

more dangerous uh try save it for the

next questions right I just wanted to

say that Innovation is is not the

regulation is not the enemy of

innovation I think bad regulation might

be the enemy of innovation but not

regulation per se and I think it's also

important not to confuse technological

development with progress not every

technological development contributes to

progress and I think the role of

Regulation is to steer technological

development so it actually contributes

to progress and that might be also a

societal there might be a dependency

depending on the culture and the

societies right so um the challenge that

we have with the AI act and Joshua and I

are involved now on the writing of the

code of practice for general purpose AI

models is how do we make sure that the

actual implementation of what the AI act

wants to do is an example of good

regulation so we are actually not
