need to put the right safeguards the

right mitigations to make sure you know

we we benefit from the risks and don't

suffer from uh we benefit from the uh uh

Ai and and not suffer from it um last

thing is we have agency that we you know

people who read this kind of thing might

be discouraged um but really the future

is in our hand uh mostly in the hands of

what governments will do and so um

advising them properly making sure they

listen to the scientific evidence is

going to be very important as we move

forward thank you for your attention um

and now I'm going to invite my uh

colleagues on the panel to uh move on to

Sage

[Music]

there

thank you very much Joshua and thank you

to all of you uh for for your

future um uh research on this area so

first let's start with a question for

you Joshua um let's talk about AI cap

capabilities in your presentation you

were mentioning the progress that have

been made in mathematics uh for example

in in scientific reasoning and and

programming and so what do you see as

the most striking Evolutions in term of

AI capabilities between the interim

report and the final version of the

report well I already answered yeah uh

with with reasoning although I you know

I must say that it's it's still hotly

debated whether just extending the
