AI that is AI That's so powerful that it

transforms the economy just as much as

the Industrial Revolution changed the

economy when we change from an

agricultural economy we're seeing a

really big change and a change that big

that's going to happen in much shorter

period of time only in in 10 or 20 years

instead of spread out over one or two

centuries we have a dashboard we're

creating to measure how closer we're

getting we have 60 indicators of whether

or not this is beginning to happen Bill

nous wrote a paper where he looked at

six indicators and he began to see some

things we're going to have a much more

detailed more real-time dashboard and

then we have a a paper that I'd be happy

to share with you called the economics

of transformative AI research agenda and

we look at these eight different

questions we don't have the answers to

these questions but uh we believe that a

question well posed is half answered so

we Define what the key questions are for

economic growth for invention and

Discovery for distribution of income for

concentration of power for geopolitics

for information communication and

knowledge for AI safety and alignment

and for meaning and well-being and by

defining these questions we're

encouraging uh other researchers and we

ourselves to work on trying to answer

them so so we can be prepared as the

technology continues to Bro

exponentially whether or not we'll have

economic understanding and Economic

Institutions that are ready to match

them because that gap between the

technology and our understanding is

where most of the challenges and most of

the opportunities for the coming decade

lie so we're calling a project Apollo

and it has a number of different

strategies we're getting new data Theory

uh we're doing a set of simulations

we're getting a community together um

and we're ultimately looking to have

impact on policy makers as we understand
