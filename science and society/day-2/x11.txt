system with synergies and trade-offs

between all the targets and I'll be

talking about that in in a few minutes

therefore one should be very aware of

the negatives because of those cascading

effects if we go into the three groups I

talked about before the most positive uh

group is actually the environment where

93% of the targets can be positively

affected by by

AI while the society exhibits the the

biggest threats so 38% of The Targets in

the society can be negatively affected

by AI in a way that we have actually

seen years after 2020 with the pandemic

with the war in Russia with many many

things that we're talking about every

day so this is important to keep in mind

for the big picture if we go into a more

detail we can actually see these two

figures on the left I'm reporting a

positive effects of AI on each of the

targets and on the right negative

effects of AI we're going to focus for

now on the light color outside where

about the darker one I'll be showing it

later and what you can see in these two

wheels is for each of the SGS sdgs one

two and three which are grouped into the

three areas Society environment and

economy this number is the percentage of

targets that are positively or

negatively affected by AI so on the left

you can see that for example SG3 on

health has 69% of the targets being

positively affected by Ai and 8% of the

targets can be negatively affected by AI

so this is an assessment that we made at

that at that time H again if you go to

the Excel you can see all the details

all the connections and the

argumentation but this is kind of like

the big picture the overall ideas that

we can actually find now you will tell

me sure but not all the references are

the same not all the evidence is equally

strong so that's why we did this extra

analysis where we took all the

references and again this is three four

references times 169 Targets this was
