Conflict something that looks like this

AI can help solve climate change but it

uses a lot of

energy I hope by the end of this talk

you will disagree strongly with this

question with this

statement there are several things wrong

with

this let's dissect first of all how AI

is helping solve climate

change which is true and then we're

going to dissect how AI is using a lot

of energy but then we're going to look

at a bunch of other things so first of

all how is AI helping to solve climate

change we've analyzed this extensively

uh at climate change AI which is the

nonprofit that I lead together with uh

Lynn Co

and I'm not going to go into all the

different ways that Ai and machine

learning can help tackle climate

change there are numerous applications

across all these different sectors from

electricity systems to buildings and

cities to agriculture forestry and other

land use and there are so many specific

ways that Ai and machine learning are

being integrated already into existing

tools for tackling the climate crisis

some overall themes that we

see first of all improving operational

efficiency taking complicated automated

systems like heating and cooling systems

in buildings helping them run more

efficiently taking the manufacturer of

Steel and cement which together

contribute about 15% of global

greenhouse gas emissions uh so we're

seeing these AI systems in everything

from Smart thermostats to the systems

that are being integrated in factories

right

now gathering information Tak big

unstructured uh data sets and turning

them into useful information to guide

policy to guide other kinds of decisions

so for example here you can see systems

that are being used um leveraging AI to
