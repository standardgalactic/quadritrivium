results were very quick and easy to see

um here's one of the the dozens of

charts from the paper um and you can see

the red line is the Improvement in the

technology

from um the people who had access to the

technology uh the other line is the

slower Improvement for people who don't

have access to technology so you see

very quickly within about two or three

months people using the llm were

beginning to outperform the people who

didn't have it and within four or five

months they were doing much better

almost double as well and and we looked

at many different kpis many different

key performance indicators and they all

showed a very similar pattern whether

you looked at how rapidly handle calls

or how many calls were resolved to the

satisfaction um interestingly you also

looked at a set of metrics about how the

customers liked it and we looked at

customer satisfaction using net promoter

scores we used did sentiment analysis

where we looked at the transcripts and

we had AI evaluate how happy the

customers were basically looking at how

many happy words versus how many Angry

Words there were in the conversations by

all these metrics customers also liked

it better so it was more productive it

was also better for the customers

finally we looked at a third group we

looked at the um the employees

themselves the agents and you know was

this a sweat shop did they become made

to work um in ways they didn't like

actually just the opposite the agents

also liked the system so they um were

less likely to quit quit turnover

decreased so all three groups the

stockholders saw better productivity the

customers had better satisfaction and

sentiment the uh the employees had less

turnover and were happier so it was a

win across the board all happening very

quickly within just a few months and the

gains were were were quite

substantial um another way to see the
