gas emissions the energy for example

that's has to be generated to power data

centers must come from somewhere here in

France you are pretty lucky that it's

nuclear energy and so it's low carbon

but other countries it's not the case

and especially data centers need a

constant supply of energy so they often

will be um uh dependent upon connected

to a grid that will have natural gas

sometimes even coal um that will power

this these data centers because you know

renewable there's no 100% I mean

especially in the case of AI specific

data centers like they're called

hyperscale Data Centers you need so much

energy that using only Renewable Power

sources is often

unrealistic um there's also the issue of

electronic waste there was recently a

really interesting article about how the

fact that we keep updating our phones

even our compute clusters our all of our

servers the fact that this is contri

contributing uh electronic waste which

is actually the most the fastest growing

type of waste globally and we don't have

very good mechanisms for handling it it

often ends up in landfills etc etc so

you know the fact that we have to buy a

new phone in order to get the latest and

greatest of AI Technologies contributes

to this kind of global issue of um

E-Waste and it it's estimated that it

would generate 5 million metric tons by

2030 in the stting and um I I alluded to

this in the in the previous slide but um

oil and gas extraction becomes more more

efficient more good uh using AI as well

and so essentially it improves

efficiency it increases yield and so

there's there's also the contribution of

AI to existing processes that are

already kind of harmful to the planet

but it's not all it's not all bad it's

it never is all bad right so there are

positive effects and there are true

positive effects that can can can truly

help help um push back and help fight

climate change so for example uh we can
