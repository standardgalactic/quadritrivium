uh apply this so we don't need to choose

uh um uh either undoing big llms and and

bigger models or smaller models we can

we can also combine uh different uh

paradigms into a hybrid

um uh solution yeah and it also help

helps to reuse components and that's

something we should also uh try to do

especially if we care about uh the

planet um and uh I also want to um

conclude uh maybe I have some more a

little bit more time yeah uh with with

one example um so because uh AI is often

uh associated with um like something

that can predict um

uh but there's a whole um Community also

within Ai and that is looking at uh

multi-agent uh systems uh yesterday we

also heard uh the connection with

economics well actually a multi-agent

systems are strong strongly linked to

concepts of economics and and Game

Theory and uh this is just one example

of a project that we have done uh long

time ago so now it's more about I'm I'm

switching uh here uh to the Viewpoint of

how can AI also help to R reduce energy

consumption so this is a project we have

done uh about 10 years ago um because in

Belgium uh we F the uh incentives of for

people to install solar panels was

really um

mismanaged uh so it was creating all

kinds of undesirable uh side effects so

we thought about okay what could be a

good incentive mechanism U to um

incentivize people to install solar

panels to trade energy and but uh at the

same time uh not take the risk of

overloading uh the grid because that

leads again to other uh problems so the

IDE was um to come up with a mechanism

where a prosumer so somebody who has

solar panels uh is being rewarded Ed for

uh green energy that is fed in the grid

but only when it was useful energy so

that means when it was being used within

uh the local community because if you

think about smart grids it's a very uh

local thing so typically you have
