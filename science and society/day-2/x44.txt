shallow new networks um became more

successful these are still the small

bees from uh the previous talk and then

you see uh another interesting thing

happening um and this is the gray Zone

that is coming in

statistical uh technique statistical

machine learning and and yeah something

like support Vector machines for example

basan networks um and some some

colleagues would argue especially like

for support Factor machines yeah is is

really AI I would say yeah it's still uh

in if you take the broader definition of

AI and we include machine learning then

I think it definitely uh has its place

and it's also no coincidence that

suddenly uh this wave uh occurred

because it it coincides with more and

more data becoming available yeah so we

we actually show saw a shift from and

doing more effort in

modeling um knowledge to extracting

insights in the data you could call it

knowledge um but can also call it

patterns so this uh has actually led to

uh very important discussions uh So

within the field there has always been

uh a tendency between let's say the two

big camps so the symbolic and and the

subs symbolic people and actually in uh

big AI conference triple AI in 88 there

has been legendary uh discussions uh in

the community about uh what is the best

way uh to

go now if we bring it to sustainability

which is uh the the topic of course of

this session um well if it comes to

energy consumption we have already seen

uh quite some uh plots uh they all

different but the main trend is the

larger the models and the more energy

they consume so we have the elephants to

the right and the bees uh to the left if

I can use the analogy of of the previous

speaker um but if it comes to human

effort yeah then it looks different yeah

if you build an expert system or or a

more uh knowledge-based uh system well

you have to get to this knowledge
