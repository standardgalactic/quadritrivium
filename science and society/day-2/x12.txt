quite some study and and consensus H to

be able to classify them into four main

categories a b c and d so the a type of

reference is the the one so this is ref

a type of a study that can be easily

generalized that can really is based on

strong methods and that can really be

implemented and that has a waiting

factor of one so basically a Target

affected positively by an a reference

counts as one and it goes down b c and d

all the way to to the lowest which is H

the D type of reference which has a

waiting factor of just 0 25 where here

what we say is that these are very

speculative references so perhaps there

is a connection but it's not very clear

how that method is reproducible or how

can it be implemented in practice so

this would give us basically a waiting

factor of 0 25 so just one quarter of a

Target would be counted when a d type of

reference is documented basically so

this classification into types of

reference uh material gives us the

darker color inside the circles so you

can actually see that by definition the

darker area is going to be smaller or

equal than the light one because The

Waiting factors go up to one H so we

basically attenuate the effect of the

references that are less strong

basically and here one can do something

quite interesting if you compare the

reduction from the light color to the

dark one so how much uh impact reduction

happens when I take into account the

strength of the evidence then you can

actually find recess gaps right because

there is a evidence that there is an

effect but you can't really point out

how strong because of the weak evidence

and we found two interesting things if

you look at the right panel the

negatives you see that the reduction in

the environment and the society is very

significant so in a way the negative

effects of AI on the environment and the

society have not been sufficiently

explored there's a lot of evidence but
