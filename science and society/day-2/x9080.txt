maybe things may change there ideas will

cease to be harder to find okay now this

is at the very micro level so now if you

look at the macro it's very interesting

with my friend our colleague anono he

looked at the share of patents in the US

patent office data set that site an AI

paper and you see that there is you see

there is searing up of the share of us

patents that site an AI paper so what I

would call them I would call them AI

patent those are patents that use AI

okay and there is a searing up there is

a surge in the share of patents using AI

now it what it mean is that it boosted

the number of patterns as I showed

before but not only the number the

quality of patterns are increasing if

you look at the patterns that are AI

patents you see that they are more cited

you see that they are more novel they

see they are more General and they see

they are more original so AI not only

increases the volume of patents but it

increases the quality of patents you do

margin original work because it gives

you access to much more possible and

helps you select among those and you do

more novel research more original

research so it's a fantastic power AI in

research Okay so now the problem the

downside is that that's fine that

technologically speaking AI has a huge

growth potential but the problem are the

humans us we don't do the right thing

competition lack of competition is a

problem if I look at the evolution of

annual total Factor productivity growth

in the US you see that there was a burst

in growth in 95 2005 that was that was

the it when the it took off so when solo

said I see computer everywhere but in

the uh in the statistic it was right

before the takeoff in '95 but then it's

good to have Solo solo speaks and then R

suddenly he proves wrong he's no longer

with us and I love Bob and you were Tau

by Bob you are taught by me you were my

student you my first year you know

assistant professor at had the privilege
