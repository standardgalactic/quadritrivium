uh you know uh human intervention even

more important and social movement even

more important and Civil Society

governments humans judgment also kunan

Innovation also there is something or

maybe uh I have a question I always ask

uh we the for there is a lot of

recombinant okay in the M it will be go

beyond the recombinant but some it

happen in our life that we decide that

at a paradigm we want to throw away the

Paradigm and and and and and start with

a new paradigm uh uh and maybe the

machine will do that but that's a

question of Judgment of intuition also

there are things that we do maybe maybe

machine will do everything but sometimes

we have a sense that something is wrong

or something has to be changed that the

political system cannot go on that uh

things have to be transformed that we

have to rethink you know international

trade and will that be left to I I see

the human element I I see more and

really the complementarity between us

and the and the Machine not not subit

ability in those respects just just a

couple of comments um I think having AI

as tools um is what most people Envision

and you're right this is what we should

be aiming at um so long as the tools are

used in beneficial ways that don't

disrupt direct that don't disrupt our

societies too much um but actually this

is not where companies are going what

they where they're going is you know

agents in other words uh entities that

that are autonomous and that could do

tasks not just over like a few

interactions or answer a few questions

but actually can take a askask for days

and weeks just like a human would and so

at that point thinking of these entities

as tools when they have their own goals

they build their own choices of how to

achieve those goals and worse than that

right now we don't know how to control

them so that they don't have their own

self-preservation goals as I mentioned

earlier um thinking about them of tools
