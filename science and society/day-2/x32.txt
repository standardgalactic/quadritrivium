after construction and Agriculture

and fast fashion is driven by online

advertising it's driven by Ai and then

there are these really complicated

effects like people talk about um

self-driving cars a lot as a you know

sort of Flagship application of AI

they're probably going to make climate

change worse and the reason is because

it's expected that self-driving cars

will lead people to drive more by

reducing the barrier to driving now it

is true that a self-driving car drives

slightly more efficiently than a person

so it uses less

energy that is counteracted by making it

easier for people to drive rebound

effect an example of a rebound effect

but um it's interesting here to to

consider that the same technology can be

used in different ways like you can use

self-driving technology for buses or for

trucks and that can have different

implications for climate change so I

basically want to leave you with here

the point that

it matters how you develop a particular

technology there are lots of different

ways to do

that and I'm not trying to say we

shouldn't

be building self-driving

cars but I am trying to say we should

think about all applications of AI when

we think about sustainability and

climate we should think about that as

one factor in what we incentivize

because if we are technologists we're

choosing what we build and how we deploy

those Technologies we're choosing

whether to use self-driving technology

for cars or for buses if we're policy

makers we're choosing what to

incentivize with like governmental

incentive

structures don't ban uses of AI in the

oil and gas industry but maybe if we're

incentivizing AI development we could

consider high-risk Technologies they

could in the AI in the eui ACT have
