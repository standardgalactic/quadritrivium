goods and services most interestingly

they enable new business models new

business processes new ways of of

creating economic

value electricity was a GPT the steam

engine was a GPT AI is perhaps the most

important and most powerful GPT of them

all now there are some things we know

about gpts and one thing about gpts is

that as I said they spawn these

compliment Innovations and by themselves

they rarely create as much value as they

ultimately do once all those complements

have been invented so in the case of

Information Technology or computers

another important GPT I studied this we

found that literally n910 of the

investment and 9/10 of the benefit were

in the complements not the technology

itself so when a company bought uh a

million dollars worth of computer

hardware they would typically buy

another 9 million dollar worth of uh

organizational process redesign uh

reskilling of the workforce

Etc all those intangible Compliments are

incredibly important and Incredibly

valuable and I think they're important

for uh AI as well now how does this a so

you need to have a whole transformation

not just buying the Transformer or the

or the technology how does this affect

measurement well it leads to something

we call the productivity J curve so

focus on the blue line there which to my

eyes looks a little bit like a j um the

reasons a j is that at first when you

get a powerful new

technology you have to invest in

changing your business processes

reskilling your Workforce thinking how

can we use this technology and while

you're doing that you're spending a lot

of management time your your your

organization is restructuring maybe

you're inventing some new products

that's costly does it instantly lead to

Output no leads to intangible

compliments but it doesn't lead to

something that the customer could buy so
