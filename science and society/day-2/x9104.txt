would do is that the people who control

these uh systems like like say open AI

potentially um they're not going to

continue just selling the access to

their

AI um they're going to give access to

you know a a a a lower grade AI they're

going to keep the really powerful ones

for themselves and they're going to

build companies that are going to

compete with the Noni you know systems

that exist and they're going to

basically Wipe Out the economies of all

the other countries which don't have

these system don't have these super

intelligence systems so it's it's you

you know you you say it's you wrote It's

not existential but I think it is

existential for uh countries who don't

build up to this kind of level of um Ai

and um it's it's it's an emergency

because it's going to take at least

several years even with the a coalition

of the willing to to bridge that Gap but

it is feasible in my opinion you look at

you know DP deep sea was a two years

project so I think this is something

totally feasible right

now um yeah and if I may add to um what

um indeed I cannot agree more that it's

feasible um and we need a to add massive

funding um public and private funding uh

to make it happen um and this was

highlighted by uh the d report um and uh

and I think that it will enable um the

Strategic autonomy uh of France and of

Europe um and have this uh collaboration

between countries in Europe and not

having only um single country mindset um

on um yeah this question

of of funding and the roles uh that's uh

being taken by by corporates and by

governments and by um academics do you

think that um the uh AI is um is

creating a lot of uh changes into this

balance it's a good it's a good

experiment I think the pilot the what we

call AI exception is the AI pilot I

think it's a good you know we have to do

it on AI primarily Europe is a
