diverse set of possible situations

meaning uh you can have communities with

uh where fewer people have solar P

panels fewer houses or where more houses

have solar panels and that's what you

see on this chart so we we simulated and

this whole Spectrum from only consumers

to only producers what we also saw is

that it has a long-term incentive so if

you would be a house in in a community

where there's fewer solar panels and

that would be also an incentive to

install um solar panels on your roof uh

if anyhow possible um because there's

still room for trading uh the green

energy uh um

so this was a mix of of multi-agent

simulation uh machine learning um so for

example cluster profiles uh using

reinforcement learning with the idea

that people would start to optimize

their energy consumption uh so that was

a system that was using very different

paradigms uh to actually come to a a

global solution and with the IDE that it

also helps um uh environment and because

it deals with green energy in a more

efficient way and I will stop with this

uh example and I'm happy to take

questions

[Applause]

thank you very much H so do we have any

question

related so we have a question

here first row

hello um thank you very much for for the

presentation you talk about these um um

if I understand correctly during your

presentation you mentioned that many

things that we now consider to be the

next thing in AI aren't in fact that new

and um have been done for for decades

now but we but we make as if they're uh

they they're a new thing and I think um

uh um to that point sometimes I get the

idea that some of my uh for example my

my fellow classmates I'm in an

engineering school they jump onto these

new things in AI like llms and

Transformers and they and they they
