you know repli replicable our work is

then also comes with benefits for

sustainability and so for example um in

AI ethics now we have data sheets and

model cards which are both used to

understand models and data sets what

they're useful for how they were trained

etc etc and what's interesting is that

until I came to hugging face carbon

footprint estimation was not part of

model cards because it wasn't considered

an ethical thing it wasn't considered

like you know you fairness and bias and

whatnot and data sourcing um because it

wasn't the same category of people so uh

we we added that category to the model

cards for example but there's still so

few data points like last time I checked

um like I think we have like a million

models or something and and a couple

like dozen have carbon footprint

estimation in their model cards so you

know despite the fact that I added this

three years ago we still haven't seen

added transparency um in terms of of

model model cards um and now the final

point I want to make is about Equity

it's really interesting when when you

when you think about it like I still

remember a time where you can U train a

model on your laptop on you know not

even like just just a CPU and and you

know um compete right you could all you

could you could compete with st the art

models for example at natural language

processing conferences at AI conferences

you didn't need access to compute you

didn't need access to gpus and nowadays

that's becoming harder and harder and so

that really comes with an equity angle

because uh modern AI research and

practice the cost in terms of computer

hardware is growing which people have

showed and that all that means that you

know the percentage of people who can

afford that cost is shrinking and not

only Hardware cost not only electricity

or or gpus but also human costs right

how do you pay and how much is an

average AI engineer in San Francisco
