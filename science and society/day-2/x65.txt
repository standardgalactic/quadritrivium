book about Cobalt uh cobalt blue I think

it's called red um and it's about how

Cobalt the the metal that's used for so

many of our devices is mined and you

know CH child uh labor modern day

slavery it's all it's all part of it and

and yet we continue upgrading to the

latest devices

so as a conclusion um there's multiple

facets of AI technologies that have to

be taken into consideration and the more

I talk to people in this field the more

I realize that it does help to have

multiple perspectives um and also for me

now you can't have an ethical

conversation I mean a a conversation

around AI ethics without talking about

sustainability and vice versa you can't

talk about you know Rising environmental

costs without thinking about the ethical

implications and so integrating the two

is not only beneficial but but really

necessary if you want to continue the

conversation and um what's interesting

is at the same time as the bruntland

report came out there was also uh Edward

barier who proposed three pillars for

sustainable development that people talk

about a lot less actually than the

bruntland report environmental

stewardship social equity and

environmental viability so his proposal

was that you can't be sustainable unless

you have all three and so even if you're

great for the planet but you can't you

know you can't um maximize social Equity

well then you're not sustainable o uh

overly uh broadly speaking and so so for

me I think that if we Center the

discussion uh around these three pillars

we can also you know take into account

capitalism because sadly we live in a

capitalistic Society but also

sustainability and Al also social Equity

without trying to optimize for one or

the other thank
