track biodiversity that's also the case

with uh systems that are being used with

satellite imagry to track uh carbon

stock monitor deforestation uh monitor

the effects of climate change like

flooding in real time Etc forecasting

taking time series data the UK's

national grid for example uh has

introduced AI systems for predicting the

supply and demand of electricity that

cut the error rate in uh half for

predictions of how much energy needed to

be produced at a given point in time in

order to meet demand this enables huge

savings in electricity

production speeding up

simulations we have very good models of

how the climate is changing but they are

very slow they can take months to run

even on super computers and AI can help

speed up models of climate and weather

and make them be more granular and more

relevant to local decision

makers and then accelerating scientific

discovery itself we need a lot of

Innovations in order to accelerate the

energy transition and AI is being used

to suggest new materials in areas like

batteries and photovoltaics like

perkits these are some of the many ways

in which AI is being used to help tackle

the climate

crisis I'm going to go into some

particular examples later on but I want

to First tackle the other side of this

what's presented as the other side AI

can help tackle climate change but it

has huge energy

consumption it does have huge energy

consumption these are graphs of

projected energy consumption by AI

algorithms starting a few years before

the present day

um all the way up to way in the future

um there's some disagreement but you can

see all the curves are going way up um

and they're going way up to places that

are actually a pretty significant

fraction of global electricity

production right now certainly
