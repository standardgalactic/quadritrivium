is wishful thinking we need to make sure

that they remain tools um regarding the

economics I'm not I'm not an economist

but I think it's really important to

project ourself and ask the question not

what AI is now or what it was three

years ago 5 years ago but where it will

be when we get to essentially all the

cognitive abilities of humans and by the

way intuition is the thing that AI is

already good at um and knowledge is

already the thing that it's very good at

right now we're seeing progress and gaps

in terms of planning in terms of

reasoning we see a lot of progress in

the last few uh months and it's going to

continue um so it's it's not clear where

we're going but but I think the picture

of how we see I now is like oh our

computer our laptop is not at all the

picture we should have about these

machines that are as smart as us which

could come in a few years or decades we

don't really

know so I I think this is exactly the

right conversation to be having I think

we are living through a paradigm change

and if we are borrowing the language of

 what we know about Paradigm change

is that it's always coming from puzzles

that need to be solved problems in the

pre-existing Paradigm but then also

competition in relationship to

potentially reigning ideas

so it's not the case that we need to

sort of see the future we get to make

the future and we will make the future

through a competitive process um you um

named the fact that you expect AI to be

perfectly good at all of the cognitive

and physical features of human life but

you didn't name the social and effective

and relational aspects of humanity which

is precisely Philipe what you're

alluding to and the nature of the

decision making so that's where what I

you know I think sort of really

important to communicate

is that the different Tech paradigms

that we're watching unfold in the world
