core of it is transparent and

essentially we don't have enough numbers

to call it either way we can say that

there's a JV Paradox but it's hard to

prove that there's a J's

Paradox and now social uh rebound

effects they're pretty much the the most

um hard to measure the least fungible

let's say are um societal rebound

effects and of course we use a AI every

day right it's having um impacts on our

societies but it's really hard to even

um measure these impacts because there's

no Baseline it's hard to say well this

has changed something in this way unless

you have something to measure and so for

example um induction effects are a type

of uh of indirect impact in uh in

economics so for example if you save

some money in one on one hand um you

have that money to spend in in in

another hand so for example um in terms

of targeted advertising in AI so for

example it's it's one of the biggest uh

applications of AI is you know every

time you do a Google search or whatever

search Bing search you have the ads at

the top of your screen that's targeted

Advertising based on your query based on

your location even based on like cookies

and things like that that that describe

who you are and what your behavior is on

the internet that's one of the core

applications of AI and so you can say

that yeah AIS has gotten uh so much uh

more efficient it's it you know we have

such powerful models but on the other

hand these models are also selling us

things 247 right and something like uh

30% of Amazon's revenue is based on this

like recommendation engine that they

have of that's that's using Ai and our

and our purchases and our history so

it's like these these effects that we

that the savings that we have with AI in

terms of you know efficiency Etc are how

do you compare the induction of um of

targeted advertising like how do you

compare apples and draws essentially

right in this case it's really hard to
