showed you on the previous plot could

probably be multiplied by two if we look

at life cycle

analysis um but of course even this life

cycle analysis cradled to the Grave

perspective it doesn't recognize ethics

it doesn't recognize inequalities and uh

in the field of AI so for example exle

as I said where the models are coming

from and also as David mentioned the

indirect effects right what if you train

a model very efficiently and then you

use it to do oil and gas exploration how

do you compare those two

things which is which brings me to my

main uh Point here about conducting the

dots between AI ethics and

sustainability and I want to start with

a quote from an iconic paper came out in

2021 and if you haven't read it you

should it's called Uh stochastic parrots

um and it was about large language

models and it was really the first paper

that opened the eyes to of many in the

AI Community about the fact that yes

these models have huge promise huge

benefits but also come with big risks um

and so a quote from this paper that I

like to cite is it fair that the

residents of the Maldives likely to be

underwater by 2100 or the 800,000 people

in Sudan affected by drastic floods pay

the en environmental price of training

and deploying ever larger English

language models even when similar large

scale models aren't being produced for

DTI or Sudanese Arabic and this really

begs the question right who is

benefiting from the Technologies who is

paying the price what's the planetary

price and and what's the social price

and I would like to add that how do we

even know the extent of these broader

impacts unless we're evaluating them

unless we're holistically evaluating

them and transparently communicating

them which bring me which brings me to

my four dots that I'd like to talk about

today uh representativity evaluation

transparency and Equity so essentially
