better um predictions much better

answers that are more coherent and that

allow these systems to choose among

possible um uh answers in in a slightly

more rational way than was the case

before one way to think about this that

like to do is that the uh systems uh

that were deployed before 01 and 03 and

and so on they produced an answer

directly from you know from the question

directly producing an answer and this is

kind of imitating human intuition where

you know you ask a question and you go

directly to um the answer whereas system

to thinking which is a a name that

psychologists have been using uh

involves deliberation where you think

about multiple possible answers and you

evaluate your own answers and then you

pick something

that works better um so so that's the uh

the new thing although it's been brewing

since 2022 with the introduction of

chain of thoughts the other thing that's

important to note in um you know the end

of 24 and the beginning of 25 is the uh

amazing effort that companies are

putting into building what's called

agents in other words system that have

more autonomy than the ones we've been

used to with chat GPT systems that can

be used to go and perform a task for a

while by themselves um you know tasks

related to web browsing coding research

tasks um and you know they're still not

as good as humans especially when the

task requires a long time for a human uh

if a human would need more than several

hours usually these systems are not as

good as humans but we're seeing like uh

pretty amazing progress uh in in these

things from the beginning of 24 to um to

now uh if we look forward uh there's

been interesting studies that help us to

anticipate the kind of bottlenecks that

may slow down these advancements in

Computing for example because of the

requirement in energy um uh or the

requirement in you know more chips that

you know uh take take uh uh Investments
