responsibility um that our uh government

our corporates uh and us as a society

have to uh tackle this

challenge I mean I don't want to you

know repat what we propos in the report

but there was a whole part of the report

I mean it's to really uh

so first part is to is to diffuse AI to

the economy so we believe that you know

we need to boost research in AI we have

fantastic mathematicians computer

science and we but there are research is

poor in France so we need we had a

previous research Minister she wanted to

slash 800 million uh uh Euros of the

fortunately the new research minister is

undoing what the previous did

fortunately uh uh but we already poor

and they wanted to slash on the research

bu so we need to have a research an

exception exception in research but we

need also to diffuse AI in the economy

firms you know because a lot is adoption

of AI by Enterprises so there have to be

and that and that takes also public

investment and and similarly we want to

introduce AI at school and at

universities in each specialized AI so

so there is a huge investment to make to

diffuse AI we need to invest in

computing power local computing power to

give access because access of new F not

only competition becoming more friendly

to entry but it's also for them to have

easier access to computing power and

that's where the it's public and private

intervention so those are the things

where really we uh you know those were

the main the main threads competition

but also public intervention in

computing power in diffusion of AI and I

think those were the but the big thing

is that Europe I want to talk about

Europe Europe is losing to the US okay

in the dragy report the letter report

the Boni report and we've seen us is in

high-tech Frontier Innovation Europe is

in midtech incremental mostly and uh we

missed out a bit on the it revolution in

Europe we don't want to miss out on the
