hungry people can just come see me but

we have a last address yes exactly will

now if you have questions you can come

see me at

lunch so I have a question regarding

Hardware yes the hardware question

Hardware question I didn't talk about

this I will talk about this during my

keynote at 130 um but um I think that

what we're seeing right now is somewhat

of a of a jein paradox essentially we

are becoming more Hardware is becoming

more efficient but we're using it more

and so essentially it's something that

we've seen with electricity something

we've seen with coal for example the

fact that just the fact that we can use

something more efficiently doesn't mean

that the overall impacts go down and

actually strangely they're going up so

hopefully you'll watch my talk at

1:30 okay thank you very

[Applause]

much so now I leave the floor to Julet

Fier on the behalf of the minister of U

ecological transition we'll make a final

comment and

address hi everyone I'll be super quick

because I know you all want to go to

lunch uh I just wanted to conclude uh by

making a link between research and

public policy so my name is Julet Fier

I'm the AI lead at the French Ministry

of environment and um I want to end this

great presentation by all the great

researchers that you saw today by

reminding uh what is our end goal here

and the end game uh with this these

presentations so uh we want to act in

the public interest of our society and

the ipcc researchers have all told us

but for this we need to ensure an

inclusive ecological transition and well

this is the endgame AI is not the

endgame it's not the Sol it's not the

what we're why we're here today it's

really ecological transition but AI is

the tool because uh achieving the

ecological transition is not an easy

task and we need all the tools that are
