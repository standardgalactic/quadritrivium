technology in the past they tend to

continue innovating in dirty technology

and suppose they had trained AI to do

the things they used to do the AI will

continue to tell them do the same thing

the AI will not say now go green not

necessarily so and what so you need to

redirect firms technical change towards

Green Technology you do that with a

carbon tax with green industrial policy

but also Civil Society the consumers

also you know when they are aware of

environmental when they are concerned by

the environment also stir firm's

Innovation towards green so you can see

the role of the you know of of govern

ments in general the state and the role

of civil society and and the triangle

between firms that innovate the state

and and Civil Society is crucial it's

true for green but you will be good for

AI we want AI that creates job we want

AI that enhance education and social

Mobility we want AI that enhance social

dialogue for example in

France compared to Germany we have a

dramatic problem of lack of social

dialogue in France my Our Hope and that

was very much the the spirit of our

report on AI is to We believe that AI

will allow social partners and unions at

to be much better informed about what's

going on in the firm and to be really to

boost the social dialogue which I think

we have a big problem of distrust in

France within firms particularly and so

again AI can can can can can go in the

wrong direction of you know uh uh

exacerbating inequality uh making jobs

uninteresting and at the opposite it can

enhance the quality of jobs the soft

skills and the social dialogue but that

is the humans we steer we are the one

who conduct we are the drivers it's not

a that will do it for us we decide what

we want that's a very clear um and so

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on um

the uh implication or the consequences

of um the um new balance of power um

we've seen um
