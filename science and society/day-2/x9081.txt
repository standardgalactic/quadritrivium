having Eric as my student yeah

okay and so you see but what you see is

that uh uh there has been a decl

there's been a decline in uh there's

been a decline in productivity growth

and a big Decline and the question is

why you had that

Decline and the problem is that you had

that decline because with the it

Revolution you had the emergence of

Superstar firms uh Google Amazon Walmart

okay those firms so that's increased

concentration so what you can see is

that you had at the same time as growth

took off you had an increase incre in

concentration so first they they push

we can see that because if you see the

average markup in the US it goes up but

not because it goes up within firms the

it's a composition effect those were the

high markup firms and they became emonic

and so what happened is that the the it

Revolution was pushed by some firms that

grew very large and when they grew very

new entry you can see that entry of new

firms has gone down so the decline in

growth that you are mentioning Eric is

very much Associated to the fact that

these same it firms that drove the

growth process you see that boosted

growth during 95 2005 they ended up

becoming an obstacle to growth because

they inhibited the entry of new firms

and uh uh and so that's why did that

because competition policy in the US did

not adapt to the it Revolution you see

they should have reformed competition

policy is very much you know Market size

market share driven not at all you say I

want to look at the effects of a merger

on future entry future Innovation data

sharing they did not adapt competition

policy and why am I worrying about that

because you see in the case of AI the
