cognition um okay yeah I'll add to uh

this list of risks and for me I think

again there are many different types of

risks but the one that I actually worry

about the most currently is uh the risk

in cyber security um for a number of

reasons so one yeah as a dual use

technology it can help both attacker

side and on the defender side so there's

a huge question uh in this case who will

AI help more uh and um and unlike many

of the other risks for example B risk

and so on like cyber security risks uh

there are like cyber security attacks

there are many different incentives why

attackers actually want to launch cyber

uh attacks all the way from nation

states to uh cyber crime and uh even to

what we call like sties and like the

amatees and so on and uh with the

increase uh improvements of a

Technologies it can potentially really

significantly reduce the cost of cyber

attacks and increase the scale of the

Cyber attack and make them much more

automated and uh today we are already

seeing in certain areas uh as yha

mentioned too for example in these uh

like fishing social engineering type of

attacks already with geni it has made a

huge um difference and we actually have

seen for example in this financial

crimes where you really have like there

is this Hong Kong Financial worker that

actually was in the teleconference call

with with his co-workers uh and he was

instructed to wire $25 million uh and he

did and later on he it was discovered

that none of those his co-workers were

real they were all actually um generated

by AI so I mean this is just examples

why uh with advancement of AI

Technologies potentially we can see huge

changes of course we want a to help

Defenders more as well there are many

challenges and I think right so this is

risk area that we really need to pay

huge attention to Don was actually

talking about you know security side I'm

going to compliment by talking about
