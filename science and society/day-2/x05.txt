for example transparency requirements

because this allow AI users and

consumers to take to make informed

choices when they are choosing an AI to

buy or where they are choosing which AI

systems to

use uh transparency sustainability

requirement in public procurement uh or

ecological bonuses and the idea is to

create a green AI Market that can drive

then the adoption of sustainable

Technologies so by this talk to conclude

uh I hope to have you convinced of three

main things the first one is that

regulation is not about restricting

behaviors and

Innovation not all Innovation is a

synonym of progress regulation can be a

tool to ensure meaningful progress

sustainable AI Reg ation is not about

flogging AI developers it is about

promoting the sustainable use

uses second facing fundamental

uncertainty it is not relevant to rely

on expected values of future benefits to

base any policymaking decision in the

short

term including a decision not to do

anything third there is value in having

having multi-disciplinary discussions on

regulation issues between regulation

Scholars computer scientists

environmental scientists psychologists

economists sociologists basically all

disciplines because all of them

contribute to a co-regulated world and

I'll finish on that

interdisciplinarity in my opinion will

be key in finding the appropriate

solution and ensure a a sustainable

future for AI thank you thank

you thank you very much Tom for this

talk so we have five minutes to take two

questions if we have some some

questions about

regulation question there

thanks very interesting talk and I very

much agree with you about the the

benefits of Regulation rather than the

problems but could you expand on what
