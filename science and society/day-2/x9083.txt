believe that deeply that automation they

thought we should tax robots it's a very

stupid idea don't tax robots it's it's a

very stupid only in France we invented

we are very good at those ideas okay so

uh uh I don't want to say who suggested

it in front Okay so now what about AI

okay so with Simon for the report and

together for the report with Yan we we

we looked we did a random survey

covering 9,000 representative French

firms than more with more than 50

employees each and we compare the

employment in firms that adopt some AI

between 2017 2020 and similar firms that

do not adopt AI so you have a treatment

group of adopters and and a control

group of non-adopters and what do we

find we find that firms that adopt AI

increase employment overall again it's a

productivity effect and how do we know

it's a productivity effect because the

sales go up as well you see so those

firms that adopt AI they have a bigger

market for their products and therefore

they employ more okay so but that's the

thing is that is that true for all types

of employment no for example for

administrative uh uh uh you know jobs

like executive secretary administrative

service are that are highly exposed and

a prior substitutable employment the

effect is not so positive so there what

we say is that we want to understand

better why is the overall effect

positive but it's not uniformly positive

on all jobs so there there is a very

interesting study by these M and Coors

from the international labor office

working paper and they they look at the

extent to which generative pre-trained

the GP PT uh you know will replace jobs

or not and what they do is they they

compose jobs into task and they and for

each task they say we we put a low score

to the tasks that have a low replacement

risk I will put a medium score for tasks

that have a medium replacement risk and

I put a high score for tasks that have

high replacement risk and you see the
