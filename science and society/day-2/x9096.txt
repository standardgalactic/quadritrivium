even more carefully about what our goals

are and and not be passive as as my

co-panelists have all been emphasizing

um we I don't think we're spending

nearly enough time thinking about this

intellectual competition about what the

what the uh values are that we want to

prioritize we're sort of I think almost

going blind stumbling ahead um with just

momentum about what's happening we need

to to step back and when I say we I mean

all of us collectively because we all

have some degree of influence over this

and think about what are the values that

we would like to see in this new world

I'm optimistic that we actually can

steer technology to a large extent and

we can use AI to to shape the kinds of

outcomes we have including ones that

have widely shared Prosperity I also

believe that a uh outcome of you know

horrific inequality and concentration of

power is very feasible and on the table

and um it will happen if we aren't more

aggressive that paper I briefly

mentioned the macroeconomics of AI we

mentioned uh Three Forks in the road and

I won't go through all of them right now

but one of the conclusions we had we

assessed each of them was that the

businesses usual the passive approach in

each case led to the worse outcome and

that the one that we wanted takes a lot

more construction you know I think

there's probably some deeper Theory

there but but building something

valuable and complex actually is a lot

harder than having a bad outcome and

luckily for most of History we humans

have done a good job of constructing

these things but as we're discovering

especially the past few weeks uh in

parts of the world it's you know things

can get torn down a lot more quickly

than they can get built up I wanted to

elaborate green let take green

Innovation green

transition we know that firms

spontaneously don't go green if you

firms that innovated a lot in dirty
