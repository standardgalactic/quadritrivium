sensors coming from a satellite there

are many different points in time and

you can use what's called

self-supervised learning to to to take

that data the structure of the data and

use it to learn better in this case you

can eliminate certain time points and

eliminate certain sensors and use the

other ones to predict that this is

what's called a MK Auto encoding

framework and we do it in a particular

structure structured way and here we are

able to basically use unlabeled data

which exist everywhere in the

world as its own

labels and what happens in practice then

is that you have these pre-learned data

representations that you're then able to

use to learn a new task from a small

amount of labeled data so you can then

go out and learn from a small data set

how to predict crop type or um classify

different kinds of trees

and this is why you end up with an

algorithm that is able to outperform all

these other algorithms because it was

designed specifically to do this thing

okay let's take a look at an another

example um very quickly um in power grid

uh optimization there's this uh problem

called AC OPF AC optimal power

flow this is the mathematical

formulation of the problem uh for the

computer scientists in the room this is

a non-convex optimization problem which

means this is hard you can't solve it

fast and what happens in practice is

because you can't solve it fast grid

operators simplify the problem they

actually linearize it and they solve a a

an an incorrect version of the problem

which means that you end up wasting

power and it's particularly a problem if

you have solar and wind power you waste

even more power so if you want to reduce

power wastage you want to solve this

problem exactly but it's hard to do you

might think why don't I just throw a

neural network at it and this doesn't

work naively basically because you would
