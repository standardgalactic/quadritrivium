training models you can uh introduce

inductive biases you should uh use

approaches like transfer learning and

most of all one should be aware of the

environmental impact of AI when running

a model when TR trying to train and and

perform inference on a model so I come

from the highper perance community and

in the high performance Computing every

time that you do a simulation you get a

bill with the economical cost of the

simulation and the CO2 impact of that

simulation so I always tell my students

that before uh running a job on 16,000

processors 32,000 processors look at the

bill but not at the economical one look

at the CO2 impact because um there's a

lot of good that can be done just by um

changing the mindset of people

developing these models right if you

know what's going to be the impact of

that simulation of that particular model

perhaps you're going to think twice

before sending the job to the big

cluster right so I think there is this

important change of mindset that is very

much needed actually so this is about

environmental uh impacts uh I want to

also provide a few examples in terms of

sg9 innovation and Industry uh there's

quite some ideas in terms of New

Opportunities uh enabl by AI H we can

optimize electricity usage for many

applications better models for Bank

performance smart cities and also being

able to smartly split tasks into simpler

um modules that can be distributed more

efficiently but of course some of the

negatives have to do also with the

uneven access to AI right so there could

be lots of jobs due to lack of

qualification and uh of course we could

have a quite an intended impact on the

global South uh if the access to AI is

hindered in certain areas right so there

is great potential we should really H be

aware of of all the problems with the

uneven access of

AI also in terms of SG4 for Quality

education there is quite some potential
