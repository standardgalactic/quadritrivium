see a little growth impact uh and very

negative employment impact of AI for

some of my colleagues okay our view in

the report in the AI report and which we

are pushing here is what I would call a

cautiously optimistic the view is that

technologically AI has grow big growth

potential and has employment creation

potential but it will all depend on the

policies and institutions that we put

together uh uh you see that we uh uh

that we put in place to uh uh along with

the technology so really the prosperity

is the joint result of technology and

institutions and the problem is that

institutions are much slower moving than

technology particularly with the AI

Revolution so let me talk first about Ai

and growth uh uh so in joint work with

Chad Jones and Ben Jones I was the only

non Jones in the team uh uh we we we we

developed a model of growth with

AI and where AI boost productivity

growth both because it automates task in

the production of good and services

because also it automate task in the

production of ideas it improves

innovation

technology uh with ideas well among

other things AI helps find solution to

complex problems it facilitates

imitation and learning and it can become

self-improving and

I don't want to bother you automation is

the idea that you you can perform

various tasks uh and the X1 xn you can

either not automate them it's it's done

with labor or you automate them it's

done with capital and capital we produce

ourselves okay and at the end of the day

uh uh the the growth of of productivity

growth the growth of way over L depends

on how much a task you automated in the

production of good and services so the

alpha when the alpha goes up the growth

in output per capita goes up but it also

depends on the efficiency on the

productivity growth on the growth of the

A and the so when you automate

production of good and services you
