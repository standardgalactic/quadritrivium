movement including somebody named Curtis

yarvin draw on Aristotle they draw on

Ancient philosophy and Aristotle's

ancient theory about natural slavery

that some people simply are meant to be

governed by others because of

differentials of talent in other words

there is no commitment to basic human

moral equality in that first Paradigm in

the Paradigm where techn technological

um innovators who are endowed with

talents Beyond others take

responsibility for the economy and

governance altogether the whole kick and

Kaboodle steer in the direction of

accelerationism right that's that moral

position and the effective altruism um

and synthetic technocracy picture the

Sam Alman picture there is human moral

equality that is why there's a need to

give from wealth to those who are less

well off so that none is unjustly

affected by a structure that means the

gains acre more to some than to others

but what's missing with regard to that

picture of human moral equality and the

effective altruism picture is the whole

of what human moral equality is about

it's not about merely that we should be

protected with regard to certain basic

material needs again human beings as the

whole creatures that we are seek

empowerment our dignity requires our

participation in the decision-making

about our own lives and that's absent

from that second Paradigm it's the third

Paradigm the plurality Paradigm or the

digital democracy Paradigm that both

recognizes human moral equality and

recognizes both aspects of that the need

for protection in our rights from

governmental in interference but also

our rights to participate as well as the

need for integration in the productive

economy in support of our material

well-being so that's the difference in

the moral Dimension with regard to the

political Dimension you've heard it

already the nrx movement seeks in effect

the Takeover of the modern nation state
