to measure there's also uh time rebound

effects once again a very very hard

thing to measure when we have time saved

using an innovation and then we have I

mean 20 sorry there's 24 hours in a day

we're going to use that time to do

something else right and so AI has saved

us time right so for example in

household tasks if we have a Roomba we

don't have to uh clean our floors uh if

we use Google Maps or or apple whatever

we we don't we save time in traffic so

typically we're supposed to have more

time left over right uh but initial

studies has actually shown that um that

time people will use for things that

have indirect I mean negative impacts on

the environment as well so for example

things like shopping or traveling Etc so

you know it's interesting because on one

on the one hand we can say that yes

we've saved time but where is that time

going and how do you quantify once again

apples and giraffes because you know on

the one hand you you saved 15 minutes

because of of a navigation app and on

the other hand you I don't know you have

more time to to to continue online

shopping right so this is a really even

in economics even like sociology it's a

really really hard thing to quantify in

terms of indirect

impacts um there's a really interesting

study let's say like that uh that

quantifies the carbon footprint of um AI

versus Humans so this came out I mean I

think it initially came out early 2024

and then it was published and so it

created a lot of a lot of Buzz and so

essentially what it did is it um took

essentially the study I did um about a

large language model called Bloom and we

estimated how many grams of CO2 for that

particular model were used for

generating text and once again um this

will depend on the architecture this

will depend on where the model is

running this will depend on all sorts of

things so they took one data point and

they also took like average carbon
