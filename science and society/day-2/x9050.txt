get stuck in Eric welcome up to the

stage thank you so much for that uh kind

introduction and I see some of our

investors in work Helix here in the uh

in the audience um so I'm delighted to

be here it's very kind of you to invite

me to this uh Gathering uh for uh for at

least a few days uh Paris is the center

of the AI universe and it's uh it's fun

to be here um what I'd like to do today

is talk a little bit about um how the

technology which is absolutely amazing

is beginning to change the economy

specifically I'm going to focus mostly

on productivity we'll talk a little bit

about the labor implications as well and

I hope we have more when we do the panel

so I'll talk first about the micro and

then the macro implications of

productivity but before I get to that

I'm just going to remind you briefly

about some of the technology I know

you've seen a lot of these today so I

only have only have one slide in the

technology just as a little summary one

of the things that I I started some

years ago with some some colleagues is

something called the AI index it's a

report very fun quick read 530 Pages

filled with charts like this one so if

you're interested in keeping up with the

latest uh data you can uh go to the AI

indexes for free on the web uh the 2024

Edition is out the 2025 Edition will

come out in about two months um and then

we have updates along the way this

particular chart is is a good summary

one because you see the progress on many

different benchmarks of course there are

there are by now hundreds of benchmarks

but um there's a pattern there you can

see going back with the first uh

Benchmark uh image net um on the far

left it seems like it's fairly flat but

at the time it seemed very steep going

from about 70% to over 100% of the

accuracy of humans the dotted line there

is a key threshold that's about how well

humans do on those different benchmarks

and you see each of the other benchmarks
