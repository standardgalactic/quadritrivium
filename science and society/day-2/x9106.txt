are too much thinking about AI to build

a product but the biggest

transformations in our society through

AI are going to come indirectly as AI is

used as a tool to device new technology

that did not exist and that's across all

the sectors uh um so this is something

that could be targeted in directions of

for example you know the the the un uh

sustainable development goals uh Health

in general and many of the issues that

exist around the world where we need a

lot more scientific research and it's

very expensive to do um there's a

potential to accelerate that research or

reduce its cost and you know do more

with less um as we uh continue on this

path but it has to be again something

intentional it's not necessarily the

thing that's the most appealing to the

commercial uh you know uh pressures or

um profit maximization eventually it

might but but you know a lot of that

work right now is actually happening in

universities and they don't have enough

compute power they don't uh retain the

the talent um so the this is a a case

where we need government investment uh

moonshots in various application areas

of AI and it doesn't always need to be

like the super large models either

although I do think that the fundamental

advances in science are going to come

because of these most advanced AIS as

well if we steer them well if we and by

the way we don't need these discoveries

to be made by AI that is agentic in

other words that is completely

autonomous we just need AI systems that

do like scientists in other words

understand how the world Works based on

the data that they have proposed

hypotheses proposed experiments but

don't need need to have goals and you

know uh long-term objectives of

themselves so two things first a big

plus one to what yosua saying about

scientific discovery that's really where

the driver of all the economic growth

and our Improvement of our living
