followup to the previous excellent

presentation so some of the initiatives

that I'm going to be talking about today

uh have to do with the sustainable

development goals uh of course I don't

have to introduce too much the sdg

agenda to this audience just to

highlight that this is a common

blueprint for prosperity for for the

whole planet H which involves 17 big

goals and 169 targets which are

basically sub goals Within These larger

ones so uh something that we wanted to

do was to H kind of assess whether

artificial intelligence can help

positively or negatively the achievement

of the SG agenda and as we know the sdg

agenda agenda involves a very broad

range of topics from uh ending poverty

to climate impacts but also economical

and societal aspects right so so it's

very broad it's a very broad uh set of

goals and the idea is that we wanted to

really go at the Target level so we

wanted to study whether AI can really

impact positively or negative or

negatively each of the 169 targets H and

this requires a quite uh big effort uh

in terms of of the team we had to put

together a very broad multidisiplinary

Team spanning all the all the range of

topics that we had to really work with

so this was published in nature

Communications in 2020 so a bit more

than five years ago and many we realized

that many of the conclusions that we had

there ER were holding through even

nowadays and some of the things that we

predicted in terms of the impact of AI

and everybody's societies and lives were

were kind of true H but of course some

of the actual analysis and and

predictions will have to be updated no

with current current data but I think

most of these uh results is still hold

quite quite true nowadays so what we did

was to put together this team so we had

10 people five men from five women from

all over the world uh we had experts in

machine learning experts in uh
