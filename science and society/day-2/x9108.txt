to make a machine do 100%

of some job or some task you can often

get it to do you know 80 90 99% um but

as we saw with self-driving cars and I

was one of the people who was fooled by

that I drove in a self-driving car in

2012 from Mountain View up to San

Francisco and I thought that it was just

around the corner to have it done and of

course that last mile literally the last

bit is is is much harder and that's true

in many many tasks so although we one of

your questions I talked about a

hypothetical future where AI can do most

things I think we have a a a significant

Runway and I don't know how long it is

where for for it'll be like chess where

there' be a lot of tasks where at first

only humans can do it and then machines

can help then at some point machines can

do it better than humans but even after

that there's going to be a period where

humans and machines can beat the Machine

by itself now with chess that that

window ultimately closed but chess when

you think about is an awfully simple you

know board compared to the complexity of

the real world so for most other tasks I

think we'll progress dress through those

different levels at at a longer pace and

and the big opportunity there is to

create AI That's more understandable and

interpretable by humans you know there

have been some studies of humans doctors

working with AI systems and um the human

plus machine did worse than the Machine

by itself contrary to what I was saying

should happen I don't think that was an

inherent uh outcome of them working

together it was because there was such a

bad user inter fa in such a bad

understanding by the doctors of when to

overrule the system and when not to but

if we could build systems that not only

say you know cut off the left leg um you

know I'm 90% sure that's the right thing

to do but explain why you want that

particular action then the doctor could

make a judgment as to whether or not to

overrule it or not overrule it and and
