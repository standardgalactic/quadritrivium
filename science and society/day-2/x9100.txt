satisfaction with redistribution so the

point is just that again you know I I if

we we need to sort of break the frame of

thinking that there's going to be one

model or sort of one version of AI and

recognize that we're actually talking

decentralizing the power means that

multiple governments somehow have a

strong voice in deciding how we use that

power and that also is going to make

sure that decisions we take are like uh

wiser more inclusive uh I think that has

lots of of of benefits now I'm not

saying this is going to be easy or even

feasible but but I think that's
