gpts and essentially this paper says

that these types of Technologies because

they're so foundational are going to

impact absolutely everything all labor

market

all economies and so they're going to

you know essentially put people out of

jobs etc etc and that means that a

single Innovation apart from you know

coal being used more efficiently AI

being used more efficiently it then has

spillover effects that are relatively

hard to quantify and so this famous

tweet by satian Nella are we seeing a

jeevan's paradox of AI I mean it really

depends on how you see it how you

quantify it the problem is is once again

that the numbers are missing and so for

example if you're coming at it from a

hardware perspective you can say that no

there's no Je Paradox because we can

just do more with less right but if

you're looking this is the recent report

from um the Lawrence Berkeley National

Lab about energy usage and data centers

um I mean this is just a plot but the

report actually says yeah we're getting

more efficient compute like for sure we

can do more flops we can calculate more

things but then the actual U energy is

rising and what's interesting is that

the authors of this study actually put

out a study 2018 I think or 2019 where

they were saying that the energy use of

data centers is flat and that's what's

been um I guess kind of the biggest

scientific article that's been cited

when people talk about data centers they

say well look at this this uh this

report from 2019 as you say see at the

beginning it's it's pretty flat the

growth is flat why are we panicking well

essentially the same authors did this

new report and they say well yeah it's

flat but it's rising quickly already and

in the next uh three years it can rise

to 12% of all energy use in the states

and so it's interesting because you know

we do have this trade-off between energy

and um and efficiency but what at the
