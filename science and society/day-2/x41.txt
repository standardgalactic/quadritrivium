mathematics in in the same way uh so my

next example uh is an example from a

system uh built by uh Tom Mitchell

already in in the 80s and today we are

surprised uh that deep SE can solve uh

mathematical problems well already in

the 80s we had systems to help with

mathematical problems and they actually

were uh dealt with in the same way as as

I was showing here in this Ming example

so with this medical expertise because

if you have to solve an

integral an indefinite uh integral in

this case uh well you you can apply a

number of operators here you see seven

of them there's of course more and the

challenge is to to apply them in the

right order yeah so it's also kind of

searching in a search tree and and a

more skilled person will know uh when to

apply which rule or to give it a higher

priority uh of uh being applied first

because probably it will lead faster uh

to this solution yeah uh so for example

the second rule is is integration by

parts and well if you're still into

solving uh integrals you will know

there's typical situations when you have

a um a cosine or a sinus in in your

formula and that that it's typical

candidate to apply to solve your uh uh

integral but you also see um learning by

experimentation acquiring refinement

problem solving juristic so also at that

time people were thinking about okay how

can we apply machine learning techniques

and in this case it were what is called

verion spaces so a very symbolic

approach um to learn when to apply which

rule or at least to give it a higher

priority a higher uh success rate that

it would be the good one to apply uh

next um today we also hear a lot about

using reinforcement learning and

together with llms to train llms and was

also in deep seek uh used but again uh

This Is Not A New Concept so this is for

example a paper in

97 where reinforcement learning was used

uh to learn uh how to use this search
