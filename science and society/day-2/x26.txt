gave were not those applications and

like I'm not trying to say that there

aren't reasons why you might use chat

GPT in in helping tackle climate change

there are certainly some but in the vast

majority of cases across sectors what's

needed are these smaller more focused

models and

so I mean I'm sort of saying you can

have your cake and eat it too let's look

at the the overall if you look at the

overall space of like what is useful

High computation AI is only useful

sometimes so if you think about this

managerie of AI algorithms all the

different use cases across

Society this is what I would like to

I would like to see some specific Cas

where we need

elephants and most of the cases we're

going to need

be's and if we try to use AI in all the

different ways that it can be useful

that means using the right tool for the

job this is what I see often being

discussed let's use llms or big

generative AI algorithms for everything

and this doesn't work not because just

the algorithms are using a lot of energy

but because they're the wrong tool for

the job if you're a farmer and you want

to pollinate your crops not to push the

metapher too much you don't want

elephants you want

bees and I'm seeing people trying to

like throw llms and other large

generative models at everything

sometimes they're useful many cases

they're not I'm seeing people saying

okay to solve the problem of large

energy usage let's make llm

smaller if you want to pollinate your

crops you don't want smaller elephants

you want bees smaller llms are still

doing the same

things and to be clear I'm not talking

about like problems with llms like

hallucinations or Fabrications they're

just not they're not designed to do

these particular things we'll get into
