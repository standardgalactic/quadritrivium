chart shows how jobs have changed over

the past about 60 years and uh while

technology has eliminated the demand for

some jobs it's also increase the demand

for other jobs to create a whole new

categories of jobs and uh we expect some

of that to continue at least in the in

the immediate

future but let me now dive into some of

the the data on the micro evidence of

productivity and there have been now an

increasing number of studies and I'm

going to talk mostly about one of the

ones that I was involved in with uh

Lindsey Raymond and Daniel Lee uh we

looked at uh use of llms large language

models to help with um a call center um

and here's an example of how it worked a

customer would ask a question like you

see in the red there and then the um the

llm would suggest some different answers

to the human But ultimately the human

was in charge so this llm was not trying

to replace the human it was augmenting

the human and this is how what we'll

talk more about this and I heard

Danielle saying earlier using AI to

augment humans is often the best way

where you get the most value so the

human could take these answers it could

just use them the way they are the human

could modify them it could completely

ignore them and give their own answer

about half the time they use something

similar very similar to what the call

center uh llm agent was recommending the

human would would use something similar

so one of the nice things as a

researcher was that we had a natural

experiment here uh well first they did

actually a controlled experiment they

had an AB test where some agents got

access to the technology and some didn't

and we used some of that but then with a

much larger sample of over 5,000 agents

they rolled it out and um they randomly

gave some agents access to it and other

agents did not so you could compare how

the agents who had the technology did

compared to the other ones and the
