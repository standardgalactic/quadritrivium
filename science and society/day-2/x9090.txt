expect uh that's surprising I think even

I think even yosua you've been surprised

haven't you yes and and so and that's

what that's what all of my uh my my very

smart uh colleagues in AI tell me that

there're that they consistently are have

been surprised recently by some of the

progress now if you take the sort of

task-based approach that Philipe

mentioned and I mentioned you can

readily see that there'll be more and

more tasks that humans currently do

especially starting with the cognitive

tasks but then increasingly some of the

physical tasks I thought they would take

longer but my friends in robotics say

that actually some of the breakthroughs

in the on the the existing Technologies

are very helpful in in creating agentic

systems for the the robotics so then you

start having a large set of the tasks

that humans do I'm not someone who

believes that there's some kind of a a

magic spark in humans that can never be

replicated um I think ultimately you

know we are made of atoms and they're

made of atoms and that in theory they

can cover a lot of the

territory one can do a thought

experiment and imagine Suppose there was

a machine that could do all of the

thinking task and all the physical tasks

that humans could do what would that

mean then we' we'd be in a very

different kind of a world and that's

part of the agenda for the economics of

transformative AI uh we can imagine that

that would likely lead to much higher

productivity which is great but I also

showed you that doesn't necessarily mean

that everyone benefits we need to come

up with some way of Distributing it we

need to think are there some things that

we would still value humans for like I

prefer to watch humans play basketball

or tennis or even chess than watching

machines do it so there may be some

intrinsic um appeal for that and there

may be some tasks like that um I think

the biggest challenge is actually going
