typically through new technologies that

are possible the negatives are typically

through unequal access or

inequalities which goes Hing hand also

with environmental impact of this uh

technology which I'm going to talk about

as well so that's a little bit that

general idea um we also explore and this

is another article in transportation

engineering this this was a year later

where we did a workshop at K Gathering a

lot of experts Max tear came to to to

also talk about this and we focus on the

indicator levels and also on um the

gender aspect where there's two types of

gender gaps in AI technology one is in

the data one is in the workforce right

so uh of course in terms of the data

there is a clear problem when you're

using this method for medical

applications or many other areas and in

terms of the workforce there is a strong

bias of the people who are also

developing these technology so you need

a all the perspectives you need all the

inclusion and diversity to be able to

develop algorithms that gather all the

perspectives so this was also that we

discussed quite a bit in terms of

sdg5 and uh here you can see some key

examples as well there is um quite some

potential in sdg 7 in terms of clean

energy and sdg 13 in terms of climate

action uh but here I would like to

highlight and again this is an estimate

from 5 years ago so probably if we would

have to do this today things would

change right but five years ago the um

idea is that the usage of data centers

in terms of electricity uh it was 1% of

the total consumption and it was

projected that by 2030 this could go up

to 20% of the total Global demand and

now we are in times of high uncertainty

this could go much higher H so one

should really be aware of how to handle

this and I I mean at the end of the day

there's all the debate of environmental

impact of AI um but of course one can

always be a smart in the way that your
