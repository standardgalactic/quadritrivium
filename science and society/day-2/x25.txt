algorithms it's the equivalent of

elephants and it's the equivalent of

little tiny insects

maybe the elephants are chat GPT deep

seek mid Journey big gen algorithms

they're constantly in the news maybe the

bees are UNS res Nets lstms physics

inform form neural networks

interpretable machine learning a lot of

different tools from Deep learning and

from from classical machine learning and

classical

AI that are much much

smaller and have sometimes literally a

billionth as much energy

usage and there are a few things that I

I want to stress with this analogy first

of all there is a huge difference in

size AI means lots of different things

but second an elephant isn't just a big

b they're different

things these gen algorithms like chat

GPT and mid Journey they're designed to

generate text images video

generally these other algorithms are

designed to do different things classify

optimize predict

on the left hand side you've got

algorithms that often have extremely

broad goals and extremely large data

sets maybe the entire internet is

basically the training data for one of

these elephant models and on the right

hand side you've got algorithms that

have generally much narrower scope and

much narrower data they might still be

what's called Foundation models but

they're not trying to do literally all

the things in the

world and then here's the kicker the

algorithms on the left are not actually

the algorithms that are being used in

all of those applications before if you

want to benefit climate change none of

those applications rely on these

elephant

algorithms just because generating text

images in video is not generally

speaking what is necessary now there are

some applications those examples that I
