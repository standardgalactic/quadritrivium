recommendation but it tries to make a

survey of the mitigation methods that

that exists and I'll tell you more about

that as well um so on the capabilities

um you have to think about what we know

what has um already been measured there

are many many different benchmarks

um I mean uh you see different systems

and and and different points in time in

the last couple of years here the

general picture which should not

surprise you is you know we see progress

across many fronts and I'll show you

some more recent data in another uh

figure also it's interesting to see that

um since the publication of the interim

report that happened in May last year A

lot has happened I'll show you some

figure of that and you know what what

what has the been the big Advance since

last May is the um progress in

reasoning um programming and math uh

these scientific disciplines um you know

the systems we had a year ago we're not

scoring very well but but now we're

seeing systems that can pass PhD level

exams that can win um competitions in

computer science and and math um so

that's kind of important to know um so

this figure shows I think uh something

easier to read um each of the curves

corresponds to different benchmarks and

they cover um uh different different uh

uh problems in language in science in

programming and math um what you see in

the last uh time point is 03 uh which

you shouldn't be surprised to to uh

learn is is making advances across many

of these scientific

areas um of course one of the things

that you probably already know is that a

lot of these advances across the years

have to do with the use of more

computational resources also known as um

uh scaling but more recently what we've

seen in 2024 and uh even in the last few

weeks with deep seek um is the potential

and uh you know amazing advance with

inference scaling where we use compute

at runtime in order to uh obtain much
