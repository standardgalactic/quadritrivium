take visual task only

23% of the task exposed to AI are

profitable to automate for American

firms but the same paper that asoglu

side say no no but that's not right

because you have cost reduction over

time it becomes increasingly profitable

to automate this task and and that same

paper by zberg at Al proposes three

scenarios annual cost reduction of 10%

20% and 50% leading respectively to 30

50 and 80% of visual task exposed to AI

that become profitable after a 20-year

period and even then visual task are not

the task for which you are not the the

the the the the the the the use of of at

for which progress is faster for example

for understanding writing and language

and I go back to the first picture that

you showed you see the the human

performance you can see that

particularly understanding writing or

language progress is much faster than

for visual task so if I restrict myself

to visual task I underestimating again

okay so uh that's the uh the speed at

which AI becomes profitably used then uh

looks at the labor cost savings it it

makes the average between a paper by no

and Zong and your 14% Eric but after

three more months you are 25% so it's

not should not be 33 should be 40 okay

and finally so at the end of the day the

range is between the 0.07 of smog glue

and up to 1.24 percentage point and with

Simo we believe that the reasonable

average is 0.68 so we get back to the

similar order of magnit itude as if we

were using the extrapolation method so

whether you use the extrapolation or a

well informed uh uh task based approach

we get that AI should improve prod when

it will take off at the time as you

explained GPT for a while nothing much

happens is the solo story remember when

solo say we see computers everywhere but

in the statistic it was right before the

takeoff of the it Revolution we see at

least 0.7 percentage point in France now

we are at 0 .8 per year it means that we
