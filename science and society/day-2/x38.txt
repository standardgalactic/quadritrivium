here and today will um to maybe put a

bit of sustainable AI in a historical

perspective so I thought of taking a bit

a different angle and then maybe

um also explain you where maybe these

bees uh can come from or why these bees

have been a bit uh yeah disappeared a

bit over time and and I think I agree

with the previous speaker uh fully that

we need more of these bees um but let me

first start with um yeah the some

history of AI because I still think it's

uh it's important to then explain what

where the technique came from and and

maybe also why they got a bit forgotten

and we should bring them back so

actually we also saw this mentioned uh

in the keynote opening keynote uh of

this event so this is um a fragment from

a proposal that was uh sent in 56 um to

organize actually a kind of uh summer

school and that was the first time where

uh the term a was more formalized and

and then later on it has been used but

what you can see is it was um studying

whether indeed intelligence uh could in

principle be made described so um

precise that it could be uh executed by

a

machine um so here you have to think

about some formalism like logic because

we are in uh 56 yeah uh another

important uh statement you see there is

in order to and to allow to improve

themselves so there was also already a

notion of learning included but I will

come back to that as well another

important part of this statement was uh

that the initial Focus was on problems

um reserved for humans so you can

translate this into uh problems for

which you have to uh study uh uh like um

medicine or repairing a car uh things

like this so you can just learn this

from experience or

mathematics that is something that is

taught to you that we give uh this uh

Knowledge from generation to generation

it's not just by looking at data and

that would not be so
