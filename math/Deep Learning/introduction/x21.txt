weight, education, foot size, interests, etc. Statistics then analyses the population’s
properties, such as for example the average height, or which is the most common
occupation. Note that for statistical analysis we have to have nice and readable data,
but deep learning will not need this.
To find the average height of a population, we take the height of all inhabitants,
add them up, and divide them by the number of inhabitants:
MEAN(height) :=
�n
i=1 heighti
n
(2.6)
The average height is also called mean of the height, and we can get a mean
for any feature which has numerical values such as weight, body mass index, etc.
Features that take numerical values are called numerical features. So the mean is
a ‘numerical middle value’, but what can we do when we need a‘middle value’,
for example, the population’s occupation? Then, we can use the mode, which is a
function which returns simply the value which occurs most often, e.g. ‘analyst’ or
‘baker’. Note that the mod can be used for numerical features, but the mode will treat
the values 19.01, 19.02 and 19000034 as ‘equally different’. This means that if we
want to take a meaningful mod, e.g. ‘monthly salary’, we should round the salary
to the nearest thousand, so that 2345 becomes 2000 and 3987 becomes 4000. This
process creates the so-called bins of data (it aggregates the data), and this kind of data
preprocessing is called binning. This is a very useful technique since it drastically
reduces the complexity of non-numerical problems and often gives a much clearer
view of what is happening in the data.
Asides from the mean and the mode, there is a third way to look at centrality.
Imagine we have a sequence 1, 2, 5, 6, 10000. With this sequence, the mod is quite
useless, since no two values repeat and there is no obvious way to do binning. It is
possible to take the mean but the mean is 2002.8, which is a lousy information, since
it tells us nothing about any part of the sequence.25 But the reason the mean failed
is due to the atypical value of 10000in the sequence. Such atypical values are called
outliers. We will be in position to define outliers more rigorously later, but this simple
intuition on outliers we have built here will be very useful for all machine learning
endeavors. Remember just that the outlier is an atypical value, not necessarily a large
value: instead of 10000, we could have had 0.0001, and this would equally be an
outlier.
When given the sequence 1, 2, 5, 6, 10000, we would like a good measure of
centrality which is not sensitive to outliers. The best-known method is called the
median. Provided that the sequence we analyse has an odd number of elements, the
median of the sequence is the value of the middle element of the sorted sequence.26
In our case, the median is 5. If we have the sequence 2, 1, 6, 3, 7, the median would
be the middle element of the sorted sequence 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 which is 3. We have noted
25Note that the mean is equally useless for describing the first four and the last member taken in
isolation.
26The sequence can be sorted in ascending or descending order, it does not matter.

that we need an odd number of elements in the sequence, but we can easily modify
the median a bit to take care of the case when we have an even number of elements:
then sort the sequence, the two ‘middlemost’ elements, and define the median to
be the mean of those two elements. Suppose we have 4, 5, 6, 2, 1, 3, then the two
elements we need are 3 and 4, and their mean (and the median of the whole sequence)
is 3.5. Note that in this case, unlike the case with an odd number of elements, the
median is not also a member of the sequence, but this is inconsequential for most
machine learning applications.
Now that we have covered the measures of central tendency,27 we turn our atten-
tion to the concepts of expected value, bias, variance and standard deviation. But
before that, we will need to address basic probability calculations and probability
distributions. Let us take a step back and consider what probability is. Imagine we
have the simplest case, a coin toss. This process is actually a simple experiment: we
have a well-defined idea, we know all possible outcomes, but we are waiting to see
the outcome of the current coin toss. We have two possible outcomes, heads and tails.
The number of all possible outcomes will be important for calculating basic prob-
abilities. The second component we need is how many times the desired outcome
happens (out of all times). In a simple coin toss, there are two possibilities, and only
one of them is heads, so P(heads) = 1
2 = 0.5, which means that the probability of
heads is 0.5. This may seem peculiar, but let us take a more elaborate example to
make it clear. Usually, probability of x is denoted as P(x) or p(x), but we prefer the
notation P(x) in this book, since probability is quite a special property and should
not be easily confused with other predicates, and this notation avoids confusion.
Suppose we have a pair of D6 dice, and we want to know what is the probability
of getting a five28 on them. As before, we will need to calculate A
B where B is the
total number of outcomes and A is the time the desired outcome happens. Let us
calculate A. We can get five on two D6 dice in the following cases:
1. First die 4, second die 1
2. First die 3, second die 2
3. First die 2, second die 3
4. First die 1, second die 4
So, we can get a five in four cases, and so A = 4. Let us calculate B now. We
are counting how many outcomes are possible on two D6 dice. If there is a 1 on
the first die, there are six possibilities for the second die. If there is a 2 on the first
die, we also have six possibilities for the second, and so up to 6 on the first die.
This means that there are 6 · 6 = 62 possibilities,29 and hence P(5) = 4
36 = 0.11.
All simple probabilities are calculated like this by counting the number of times the
27This is the ‘official’ name for the mean, median and mode.
28Not 5 on one die or the other, but 5 as in when you need to roll a 5 in Monopoly® to buy that last
street you need to start building houses.
29In 62, the 6 denotes the number of values on each die, and the 2 denotes the number of dice used.

desired outcome will occur and dividing it by the number of all possible outcomes.
