Mathematical and Computational Prerequisites
A function f is called monotone if for every x and y from the domain (for which
the function is defined) the following holds: if x < y then f (x) ≤ f (y) or if x > y then
f (x) ≥ f (y). Depending on the direction, this is called an increasing or decreasing
function, and if we have < instead of ≤, it is called strictly increasing (or strictly
decreasing). A continuous function is a function that does not have gaps. For what
we will be needing now, this definition is good enough—we are imprecise, but we
are sacrificing precision for clearness. We will be returning to this later.
One interesting function is the characteristic function for rational numbers over
all real numbers. This function returns 1 if and only if the real number it picked is
also a rational number. This function is continuous nowhere. A different function
which is continuous in parts but not everywhere is the so-called step function (we
will mention it again briefly in Chap.4):
step0(x) =
�
1, x > 0
−1, x ≤ 0
Note that step0 can be easily generalized to stepn by simply placing n instead of 0.
Also, note that the 1 and −1 are entirely arbitrary, so we can put any values instead. A
step function that takes in an n-dimensional vector is also sometimes called a voting
function, but we will keep calling it a step function. In this version, all components of
the input vector of the function are added before being compared with the threshold
n (the threshold n is called a bias in neural network literature). Pay close attention
to how we defined the step function with two cases: if a function is defined by cases,
it is an important hint that the function might not be continuous. It is not always the
case (in either way we look at it), but it is a good hint to follow and it is often true.5
Before continuing to derivations, we will be needing a few more concepts. If the
outputs of the function f approach a value c (and settle in it), we say that the function
converges in c. If there is no such value, the function is called divergent. In most
mathematics textbooks, the definitions of convergence are more meticulous, but we
will not be needing the additional mathematical finesse in this book, just the general
intuition.
An important constant we will use is the Euler number, e = 2.718281828459 . . ..
This is a constant and we will reserve for it the letter e. We will be using the basic
numerical operations extensively, and we give a brief overview of their behaviour
and notations used here:
• The reciprocal number of x is 1
x or equivalently x−1
• The square root of x is x
1
2 or equivalently √x
• The exponential function has the properties: x0 = 1, x1 = x, xn · xm = xn+m,
(xn)m = xn·m
5The ReLU or rectified linear unit defined by ρ(x) = max(x, 0) is an example of a function that is
continuous even though it is (usually) defined by cases. We will be using ReLU extensively from
Chap.6 onwards.

• The logarithmic function has the properties: logc 1 = 0, logc c = 1, logc(xy) =
logc x + logc y,
logc( x
y) = logc x − logc y,
logc xy = y logc x,
logx y = logc y
logc x,
logx xy = y, xlogx y = y, ln x := loge x).
The last concept we will need before continuing to derivations is the concept of
a limit. An intuitive definition would be that the limit of a function is a value which
the outputs of the function approach but never reach.6 The trick is that the limit of
the function is considered in relation to a change in inputs and it must be a concrete
value, i.e. if the limit is ∞ or −∞, we do not call it a limit. Note that this means
that for the limit to exist it must be a finite value. For example, lim
x→5 f (x) = 10, if we
take f to be f (x) = 2x. It is of vital importance not to confuse the number 5 which
the inputs approach and the limit, 10, which the outputs of the function approach as
the inputs approach 5.
The concept of limit is trivial (and mathematically weird) if we think of integer
inputs. We shall assume when we think of limits that we are considering real numbers
as inputs (where the idea of continuity makes sense). Therefore, when talking about
limits (and derivations), the input vectors are real numbers and we want the function
to be continuous (but sometimes it might not be). If we want to know a limit of a
function, and it is continuous everywhere, we can try to plug in the value to which
the inputs approach and see what we get for the output. If there are problems with
this, we can either try to simplify the function expression or see what is happening
to the pieces. In practice,7 the problems occur in two way: (i) the function is defined
by cases or (ii) there are segments where the outputs are undefined due to a hidden
division by 0 for some inputs.
We can now replace our intuitive idea of continuity with a more rigorous definition.
We call a function f continuous in a point x = a if and only if the following conditions
hold:
1. f (a) is defined
2. lim
x→a f (x) exists
3. f (a) = lim
x→a f (x).
A function is called continuous everywhere if and only if it is continuous in all
points. Note that all elementary functions are continuous everywhere8 and so are all
6This is why 0.999 · · · ̸= 1.
7This is especially true in programming, since when we program we need to approximate functions
with real numbers by using functions with rational numbers. This approximation also goes a long
way in terms of intuition, so it is good to think about this when trying to figure out how a function
will behave.
8With the exception of division where the divisor is 0. In this case, the division function is undefined,
and therefore the notion of continuity does not have any meaning in this point.
