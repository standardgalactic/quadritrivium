We turn our attention to the rules of differentiation. All of these rules can be
derived just as we did with the rules used above, but it is easier to remember the rules
than the actual derivations of the rules, especially since the focus in this book is not

on calculus. One of the most basic things regarding derivatives is that the derivative
of a constant is always 0. Also, the derivative of the differentiation variable is always
1, or, in symbols, dy
dxx = 1. The constant has to have a slope 0 and a function f (x) = x
will have horizontal component equal to the vertical component and the slope will
be 1. Also, to get f (x) from f (x) = ax + b, a has to be 1 to leave the x and b has to
be 0.
The next rule is the so-called exponential rule. We have seen this rule derived in the
aboveexample: d
dxa · xn = a · n · xn−1.Wehaveplacedthea thatshowhowapossible
factor behaves. The rules for addition and subtraction are rather straightforward:
dy
dx(k + j) = dy
dxk + dy
dxj and dy
dx(k − j) = dy
dxk − dy
dxj. The rules for differentiation in
the case of multiplication and division are more complex. We give two examples and
we leave it to the reader to extrapolate the general form of the rules. If we have y =
x3 · 10x then y′ = (x3)′ · 10x + x3 · (10x)′, and if y = x3
10x then y = (x3)′·10x−x3·(10x)′
(10x)2
.
The last rule we need is the so-called chain rule (not to be confused with the chain
rule for exponents). The chain rule says dy
dx = dy
du · du
dx , for some u. There is a similarity
with fractions that goes a long way in terms of intuition.12 Let us see an example.
Let h(x) = (3 − 2x)5. We can look at this function as if it were two functions: the
first is g(u) which gives some number y = u5 (in our case this is u = 3 − 2x), and
the second function which just gives u is f (x) = 3 − 2x. The chain rule says that to
differentiate y by x (i.e. to get dy
dx), we can instead differentiate y by u (which is dy
du),
u by x ( du
dy ) and simply multiply the two.13
To see the chain rule in action, take the function f (x) =
√
3x2 − x (i.e. y =
√
3x2 − x). Then, f ′(x) = dy
du · du
dx , which means that y = √u and so du
dx = 1
2u− 1
2 .
On the other hand, u = 3x2 − x, and so du
dx = 6x − 1. From this we get dy
du · du
dx =
1
2u− 1
2 · (6x − 1) = 1
2 ·

√u · (6x − 1) = 6x−1
2√u =
6x−1

3x2−x.
The chain rule is the soul of backpropagation, which in turn is the heart of deep
learning. This is done via function minimization, which we will address in detail in
the next section where we will explain gradient descent. To summarize what we said
and to add a few simple rules14 we shall need, we give the following list of rules
together with their ‘names’ and a brief explanation:
• LD: Differentiation is linear, so we can differentiate the summands separately and
take out the constant factors: [a · f (x) + b · g(x)]′ = a · f ′(x) + b · g′(x).
• Rec: Reciprocal rule [ 1
f (x)]′ = − f ′(x)
f (x)2 .
12The chain rule in Lagrange notation is more clumsy and void of the intuitive similarity with
fractions: h′(x) = f ′(g(x))g′(x).
13Keep in mind that h(x) = g(f (x)) = (g ◦ f )(x) = g(u) ◦ f (x), which means that h is the com-
position of the functions g and f . It is very important not to mix up compositions of func-
tions like f (x) = (3 − 2x)5 with an ordinary function like f (x) = 3 − 2x5, or with a product like
