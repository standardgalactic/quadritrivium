Now, we turn our attention to matrix multiplication. Matrix multiplication is not
commutative, so AB ̸= BA. To multiply two matrices, they have to have matching
dimensions. So if we want to multiply A with B (that is to calculate AB), A has to be
m × q dimensional and b has to be q × t dimensional. The resulting matrix AB has
to be m × t dimensional. This idea of ‘dimensionality agreement’ is very important
for matrix multiplication to work out. It is a matter of convention, but by taking this
convention and saying that this is how matrices are to be multiplied, we will go a
long way, and be computationally fast all the time, so it is well worth it.
If we multiply two matrices A and B, we will get the matrix C (= AB) as the
result (of the dimensions we specified above). The matrix C consists of elements cij.
For every element cij, we get it by computing the dot product of two vectors: the
row vector i from A and the column vector j from B (the column vector has to be
transposed to get a standard row vector). Intuitively, this makes perfect sense: when
we have an element ckm, k is the row and m is the column, so it is sensible that this

element comes from the k-th row of A and the m-th column of B. An example will

Let us check the dimensions first: matrix A is 4 × 2 dimensional, and matrix
B is 2 × 3 dimensional. They have the 2 ‘connecting’ them, and therefore we can
multiply these two matrices and we will get a 4 × 3 dimensional matrix as a result.

We will call the resulting 4 × 3 dimensional matrix C. Let us show the full cal-
culations of all entries cij:
• c11 = 4 · 3 + (−1) · 9 = 3
• c12 = −3 · 3 + 0 · 9 = −9
• c13 = 13 · 3 + 6 · 9 = 93
• c14 = −5 · 3 + 1 · 9 = −6
• c21 = 4 · (−4) + (−1) · 1 = −17
• c22 = −3 · (−4) + 0 · 1 = 12
• c23 = 13 · (−4) + 6 · 1 = −46
• c24 = 5 · (−4) + 1 · 1 = 21
• c31 = 4 · 5 + (−1) · 12 = 8
• c32 = −3 · 5 + 0 · 12 = −15
• c33 = 13 · 5 + 6 · 12 = 137
• c34 = −5 · 5 + 1 · 12 = −13
