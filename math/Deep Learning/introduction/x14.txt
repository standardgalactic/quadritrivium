Now, we are all set to continue our journey to differentiation.10 We can develop a
bit of intuition behind derivatives by noting that the derivative of a function can be
imagined as the slope of the plot of that function in a given point. You can see an
illustration in Fig.2.1. If a function f (x) (the domain is X ) has a derivative in every
point a ∈ X , then there exists a new function g(x) which maps all values from X to
its derivative. This function is called the derivative of f . As g(x) depends on f and x,
we introduce the notation f ′(x) (Lagrange notation) or, remembering that f (x) = y,
we can use the notation dy
dx or df
dx (Leibniz notation). We will deliberately use these
two notations inconsistently in this book, since some ideas are more intuitive when
expressed in one notation, while some are more intuitive in the other. And we want
to focus on the underlying mathematical phenomena, not the notational tidiness.
Let us address this in more detail. Suppose we have a function f (x) = x
2. The slope
of this function can be obtained by selecting two points from it, e.g. t1 = (x1, y1)
and t2 = (x2, y2). Without loss of generality, we can assume that t1 comes before t2,

g(x) where f and g are polynomial functions.

i.e. that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2. The slope is then equal to y2−y1
x2−x1 , which is the ratio of
the vertical and horizontal segments. If we restrict our attention to linear functions
of the form f (x) = ax + b, we can see a couple of things. First, the slope is actually
a (you can easily verify this) and it is the same in every point, and second, that the
slope of a constant11 must be 0, and the constant is then b.
Let us take a more complex example such as f (x) = x2. Here, the slope is not the
same in every point and by the above calculation we will not be able to get much
out of it, and we will have to use differentiation. But differentiation is still just an
elaboration of the slope idea. Let us start with the slope formula and see where it
takes us when we try to formalize it a bit. So we start with y2−y1
x2−x1 . We can denote with
h the change in x with which we get x2 from x1. This means that the numerator can
be written as f (x + h) − f (x), and the denominator is just h by definition of h. The
derivative is then defined as the limit of that as h approaches 0, or
f ′(x) = dy

(2.1)
Let us see how we can get the derivative f ′(x) of the function f (x) = 3x2. We will
give the rules to calculate the derivative a bit later, and using these rules we would
quickly find that f ′(x) = 6x, but let us see now how we can get this by using only
the definition of the derivative:
1. f (x) = 3x2 [initial function]
2. f ′(x) = lim
h→0
(f (x+h)−f (x)
h
[definition of the derivative]
3. f ′(x) = lim
h→0
(3(x+h)2−3x2
h
[we get this by substituting the expression from row
1in the expression in row 2]
4. f ′(x) = lim
h→0
(3(x2+2xh+h2)−3x2
h
[from row 3, by squaring the sum]
5. f ′(x) = lim
h→0
(3x2+6xh+3h2−3x2

[from row 4, by multiplying]
6. f ′(x) = lim
