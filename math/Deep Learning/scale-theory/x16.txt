5.5—This notion clarifies the change of perspective entailed by scale. In “resolving” the decimal or, if you’d prefer, in the fractionation of the 1, one is selecting out of the One a portion of it to examine at a particular level of detail. (Note that there is no “outside” the 1 here [see 1.23, 2.27, 6.44] but rather a specification of how whatever is is being viewed within that 1.)
5.6—With this schema, we can conceptualize the way scale provides layers of existence within the same “thing.” At 0.285038472 one might observe a galaxy, but then at 0.28503847234130979123236719 one might observe a cow.

5.7—This experiment clarifies how to think of scale as resolution. The decimal describes an alteration of perspective, which changes what you are able to observe at any given degree of specification.

5.8—If we apply this to what is currently observed within the scale ranges of the cosmos, we can specify the scale domains as divisions of this 1. First, using the meter as our reference point (see 2.14), we can specify the relative size range of major objects (Figure 5). We can then convert these differences into a chart for the scale domains (defined at 3.35) by simply counting down from the largest size, in this case 1 × 1026meters, so that we have a decimal correlating with these differences in size. We could then chart the resolution 0.2516831261814905484783968731932660873193964038 as in Figure 6.1
5.9—This conception permits us to specify thresholds with some degree of accuracy by considering when and where a logical typing in objects actually occurs, as is already labeled in the third column in Figure 6. Here we can see how scalar thresholds are made possible by their logarithmic nature. Because we are dealing in orders of magnitude, we could think of thresholds as singularity points for objects of relevance on each scale.

5.10—As noted in 3.37, there are some transitional ranges where one might place a phenomenon in one or the other threshold depending on whether we privilege one scale or another, such as geological features. Given this situation, it may be worthwhile to distinguish a kind of medial zone where one observes what might be described as the accumulated objects of a lower scale or aspects of a higher-scale object. These would be: components of a galaxy, patterns or sections in a solar system (e.g., an asteroid belt), parts of a star or planet (e.g., landscape features, continents, ecosystems, geological features, ocean patterns), organs or object components (e.g., rock patterns), organelles or macromolecules, and the ranges of forces or orbitals in or around an atom. However, the major point of defining thresholds is to attend to logical typing as a function of levels of resolution, not the particular objects of relevance(3.6, 3.30). Thus, macromolecules may be as complicated and large as a virus and therefore find themselves in the single-celled range. This is no problem: if these macromolecules form big enough chains they can become an even larger object—a rock or a diamond. It is not necessarily the kind of object we’re trying to highlight but the thresholds of interactability.
