Figure 5:Major objects and their sizes. These are estimates that often fall within a limited range; what is given here should provide a general schematic. For an ongoing compendium of these comparable sizes see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(length)
5.11—This mode of specification fits with what is called “scale analysis” in various science and engineering fields. Scale analysis is a method of approximation that simplifies potentially complex equations by eliminating sufficiently small variables. When studying a process or attributes of an object that is primarily definable at one scale, one can successfully eliminate variables beyond a certain point and find that your calculation is perfectly adequate. This thought experiment suggests that a broader conception of scale analysis (perhaps more adequately called scale-specific analysisor principles of specification) is needed as a general method.

5.12—This experiment translates some problems in mathematics into the context of physical systems. Most importantly, it creates a logical typing of sets along a continuum that is tied to size. This physical logical typing carries with it the same problems already developed by Russell (see 3.6), particularly the warning that one must specify the logical type (i.e., scale) of description and be careful when creating rules or defining relations across these logical types (3.32).
