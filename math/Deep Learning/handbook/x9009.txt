20.2.1 Improving Diagnosis
There are many papers that report results from applying EAs to  cancerdiagnosis. Many of these apply standard EA approaches to off-the-shelf data sets, e.g. those in the UCI repository [21]. In the interests of space, we do not review these. Instead, we focus on studies in which a clear medical or clinical need is being addressed.
One area in which EAs are often applied in a diagnostic context is feature selection. A good example of this is in microarray data analysis. Microarray data sets, which capture snapshots of the biochemical components present in a biological sample at a particular time, typically comprise many features for a comparatively small number of samples. To identify useful sets of biomarkers for use in clinical diagnosis, and avoid overfitting, it is important to reduce the number of features. Various studies have shown EAs to be effective at doing this. A recent example is reported in [72], where a multi-objective memetic algorithm was used to find molecular signatures for five different types of cancer. Notably, the authors found this approach to be more effective than other methods both for finding a minimal set of predictive biomarkers and for finding a set of biomarkers with high predictive accuracy. EAs have also been applied to feature selectionwithin other kinds of  cancerdata. For instance, in [24], the authors used an EA to select MRI features for use in a logistic regressionmodel used for breast cancerdiagnosis. This allowed them to identify a number of 3D imaging features that could potentially be used as clinical biomarkers.
Other research has focused not only on the identification of biomarkers but also on understanding the interactions between biomarkers within the diagnostic process. A popular approach in this context is genetic programming (GP), specifically the use of symbolic regressionto find equations that describe the relationship between a group of biomarkers and a diagnostic outcome. An early example of this is our own work on using Cartesian GP for diagnosing head and neck cancersfrom Raman spectroscopy data [41], where we were able to derive equations that captured the relationships between Raman spectra and disease severity. There are also a number of more recent examples, most of which have used GP variants that represent solutions using multiple trees. For example, in [22], this approach was used to discover a minimal set of biomarkers for use in the early diagnosisof cancersfrom non-invasive fluid samples. A similar approach was later applied to diagnosing pancreatic cancer [15]. However, work by [2] particularly highlights the benefits of using multi-tree GP. The authors applied this approach to skin cancer diagnosis from image data, using individual trees within each solution to construct features from different low-level feature pools. The constructed features represented by the individual trees were then shown to be beneficial when building conventional ML models to perform diagnosis. The authors also demonstrated that the constructed features were interpretable, which is arguably an important advantage of GP over neural network-based approaches to feature construction
Other work has focused on constructing features directly from image data, rather than relying on previously extracted low-level features. This includes early work by one of the authors, which used Cartesian GP to construct features and classifiers to diagnose breast cancerfrom mammograms [79]. However, whilst there has been more recent work on de novofeature constructionand image classificationusing GP, this is an area that is now more commonly addressed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Instead, EAs are increasingly being used in concert with CNNs. We will discuss this later when we get to COVID-19diagnosis. However, a good example within cancerdiagnosisis reported in [86], where an evolutionary strategy was used to optimise the hyperparameters of a DNN model used for classifying lung cancer malignancy. Two notable aspects of this approach were the use of fitness surrogates, motivated by the expensive training times of DNNs, and an importance-based mutation operator. The latter allowed the algorithm to focus on hyperparameters which have a particularly large effect on performance, which in their case included the convolutional feature maps and the dropout rates.
Another paper worth noting is [82], where complex networkswere evolved to diagnose cancerfrom DNA microarray data. Complex networks, within this context, are similar to neural networks, but with scale-free or small-world topologies, and non-standard activation functions. The authors used a combination of GP to evolve the topology, and PSO to optimise the parameters, and were able to generate ensemble classifiers that outperformed various conventional ML models, including ensembles of neural networks. This highlights another prominent advantage of EAs: the ability to optimise a wide range of models.
There are also examples of EAs being applied to prognosis rather thandiagnosis [1, 25, 44, 47]. On the whole, these use similar methods to those already described. For example, in [25], an EA was used to carry out feature selectionof imaging features in the construction of radiogenomic models used to predict survival outcomes of patients. In [1], the authors use an EA to optimise the hyperparameters of DNN models in order to predict the outcome of breast cancer, though it is notable that they used an MOEA (specifically NSGA-III) to explore trade-offs between different metrics.
20.2.2 Improving Treatment
EAs have been used in a number of studies that aim to design or optimise treatments for cancer, with the majority of these studies focusing on chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
The largest group of recent papers addresses the problem of designing treatment plans [46, 58, 62, 67, 75, 80]. For both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, there is typically a need to maximise the treated area (i.e. the removal of cancerous cells) whilst minimising the impact on healthy tissue. Such problems can naturally be versed as multi-objective optimisation problems and solved using various forms of multi-objective EAs, and there are a number of examples of this approach. For example, NSGA-IIhas been used to plan multi-drug chemotherapy schedules for treating late-stage drug-resistant tumours [58], and it has been shown that optimisation of chemotherapy schedules can be improved by hybridising multiple MOEAs [67]. In both [62] and [46], it was shown that MOEAs can be used to plan brachytherapy, a form of radiation therapy that involves moving radiation sources through the body. A particularly nice study of applying MOEAs can be found in [75], where the authors demonstrate how more advanced approaches can be used to solve radiotherapy planning problems that have a large number of objectives and parameters. In addition to generating better treatment plans, in both [46] and [75], it is noted that MOEA-based approaches also play an important role in reducing the amount of time it takes to plan treatments.
EAs are also being applied to the design of new cancertreatments. Both [4] and [34] used GAs in studies that addressed the early stages of the anti-cancer drug pipeline. In [4], the GA was used in the process of finding gene targets for immune-checkpoint therapy, i.e. looking for new drug targets that play an important role in regulating the activity of immune cells within cancerous tumours. The authors report that they were able to identify several potential drug targets using this approach. By comparison, [34] addressed the problem of repurposing existing drugs for anti-cancer treatment, by identifying potential associations between existing drugs and the genetic components of cancercells. In both of these papers, the GA was used to identify gene associations.
In [74], we pursued a different approach to designing novel treatments. Canceris often the result of a cell’s gene regulatory dynamics entering an abnormal attractor, so we considered whether a GA could be used to design a controllerto guide a diseased cell back to a healthy state. Specifically, we used a GA to optimise the structure and parameters of a Boolean network, since these have the potential to be deployed within a cellular environment using synthetic biology principles. Our results showed that it is possible to create optimal controllersfor a range of different cell types, with good scalability. This is also another example of an EA being used to optimise a fairly non-standard computational model.
Another important issue in drug-based cancertherapies is the deployment of anti-cancer medications to affected cells and tissues. Both [71, 76] addressed this by focusing on the design of nanoparticle systems. By delivering anti-cancer drugs to specific cells, nanoparticles offer significant potential for carrying out more targeted treatment at lower dosages. One difficulty is that there are many degrees of freedom when designing nanoparticles, and both groups of authors noted that their use of an EA was motivated by the need to find optimal solutions within these large search spaces. In [71], a GA was used to design the characteristics of the nanoparticles themselves, including their concentration, size, binding affinities and payloads. The candidate designs were evaluated using a complex agent-based simulation of tumour growth and nanoparticle transport, and could successfully target over 90% of cancercells whilst maintaining a low dosage. Using this approach, the authors were able to find suitable designs for both homogenous tumours and mildly heterogeneous tumours. In [76], the authors focused on heterogeneous tumours with larger degrees of differentiation. In these kinds of tumours, the presence of multiple cell types can lead to drug resistance. To address this, a variable-length EA with parsimony pressure was used to optimise the application times of multiple nanoparticles, with this more dynamic approach allowing them to find solutions that could successfully target highly differentiated tumours, at least when evaluated in simulation.
Many of the approaches mentioned above rely on in silicosimulatorsof cancersystems in order to evaluate their solutions. Consequently, the accuracy of these simulators is a key factor in the design of meaningful solutions. In this respect, it is also worth noting the work reported in [53], where a GA was used to parameterise a model of lung cancermetastasis in order to improve its fit to real-world data.
