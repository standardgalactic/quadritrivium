Predictive accuracy-based results comparing the (Geometric Mean of Sensitivity and Specificity) of LGAFFS to a weighted GA (WGA) using a Random Forest base classifier across all dataset/sensitive feature combinations. The average rank of each algorithm is shown in the penultimate row of the table, followed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test Pvalue

Recallthat the highest priority objective for LGAFFS is the predictive accuracymeasure (). The experimental results of the comparison between LGAFFS and the WGA with respect to this measure are found in Table  17.2. In each row of this table (i.e. for each pair of a dataset and a sensitive feature), the best result is shown in boldface. The last but one row of the table shows the average rank obtained by each approach (the lower the rank, the better the result), whilst the last row shows the p-value obtained by the Wilcoxon signed-rank statistical significance test. We can see that the average rank of both algorithms is similar and no statistical significance is found between the two algorithms (at the usual significance level of ), with LGAFFS performing better in 11 classification problems (combinations of dataset and sensitive feature) and WGA performing better in 10 classification problems.
However, regarding the secondary objective of fairness(aggregating four fairness measures), the two algorithms have substantially different performances, as can be observed in Table  17.3. It should be noted that three fairness measures(DS, FPERBS and FNERBS) have been slightly modified from the equations shown in Sect.  17.2, which are to be minimised, by computing instead 1 minus the value in each of those equations (e.g. DSwas re-defined as 1 minus the DSformula shown in Eq.  17.1), so that all objectives are now to be maximised. Statistically significant results, at the usual significance level of , are marked with a red triangle in the tableâ€™s last row. These results show that LGAFFS significantly outperformed WGA in three of the four fairness measures: discrimination score, FPERBS and FNERBS, which are all measures of fairness at the group level (i.e. for a group of individuals in the datasets). By contrast, there is no significance and very similar average rank for the consistency measure, which is the only measure of fairnessat the individual level (i.e. at the level of a data instance) in these experiments.
