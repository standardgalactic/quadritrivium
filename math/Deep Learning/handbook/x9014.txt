Abstract
This chapter aims to give an overview of recent applications of Evolutionary Machine Learning (EML) to control including opportunities and challenges. Control is at the heart of engineering applications. Examples include regulation, stabilization, reference tracking, synchronization, and coordination. Yet, control design of complex systems may be challenged by high dimensionality, nonlinearities, and delayed responses. A new path for control design is to reformulate the control problem as a regression problem to leverage powerful Machine Learning (ML) methods. In particular, bio-inspired ML methods are well adapted for solving control tasks thanks to easy deployment, interpretability, and little/no prior knowledge of the system to control needed. Hence, since the 50s, EML methods have been successful in optimizing intelligent controllersto solve many control tasks, including adaptive, multi-objective, robust control for robotics, electric engineering, and fluid mechanics, to cite a few examples.
22.1 Introduction22.1.1 Control Theory
Control is the engineering field that aims to bring a dynamic system to a desired state or to behave in a desired way. We restrain this study to autonomous systems, i.e., systems that are invariant in time. In this framework, the dynamical system, also called plant (P), includes one or several actuators and sensors. The sensors provide at least partial information about the system state and characterize the control’s performance. The sensor signals are collected in a vectorial quantity noted by; they are also referred to as the plant’s outputs. The actuators manipulate the plant to achieve a control objective, and are driven by the actuation command, noted by ; the latter is also referred to as the plant’s input. A control law determines the actuation command. The controlleris the control unit, while the control law is a function from the space of sensor signals to the space of all possible actions, i.e., the actuation space; In sensor-based feedback, the control law is a mappingfrom the sensor signals to the actuation command. In the following, the controller is denoted K, and the control law . The control objectiveis to derive the optimal controllaw that best fulfills the control objective. Following the control problem, the objective may be to control the system such that its outputs match a reference signal, noted . There are two types of controls.
Open-loop control. The actuation command is a signal independent of the state of the system. It can be a function of a reference signal or other signals.
Closed-loop control. The actuation command is a function of the system state.
The design of a controllerK needs to reduce the impact of external disturbances and sensor noise 
Fig. 22.1
Control loop diagram. The controller(K) sends an actuation command to the plant (P). The plant gives back a sensor signal that is information on the plant state. The plant is subject to external disturbances and measurement noise . For open-loop control, the actuation command is typically a function of a reference signal . For closed loop, the actuation command is also a function of the sensor signal . The dashed line indicates state feedback for closed-loop control only
Figure  22.1summarizes the elements of the control loop.
22.1.2 Challenges and Current Methods for Control Design
Control design for real systems is challenged by several factors:
High-dimensionality of the state space and the actuation space;
Nonlinearities of the plant;
