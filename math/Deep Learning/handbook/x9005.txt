Especially in summer, fire is the most destructive force in the Portuguese forest. Typically, there are between 15.000 and 25.000 forest fires each year across the whole country  [79]. In  [121], the authors use a GA to evolve the weights of ANNs. This model is then used to predict probabilities of fire ignitions in several municipalities. In  [26], the authors compare GSGP with other well-known methods, including ANNs, to predict the sizes of burnt areas, while taking into consideration the characteristics of the terrain.
With more than half the world’s population living in urban areas, air pollution is another theme of high importance in environmental science. Ozone concentration levels are related to air pollution, and low concentration levels have a negative impact on human health. The authors of  [23] propose a new variant to the GSGP algorithm and compare it with GSGP and other well-known methods, including ANNs, to predict ozone concentration levels in the region of Yuen Long, one of the most polluted regions in China. This work proposes a faster method with better results and lower variance across the different runs. In  [78], the authors propose a GA-based algorithm based on iterative rule learning. This algorithm is then used to detect atmospheric pollution by evolving a set of rules that are applied to the detection of high ozone concentration levels, nitrogen monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Later, in  [77], the authors propose a new GA-based algorithm to evolve association rules for the detection of high ozone concentration levels.
Water-related environmental issues have also been the theme of some works. In  [61], the authors use Std-GP to predict the quantity of the Microcystis aeruginosabacteria in the Nakdong River in South Korea. In this work, the authors use two variants of Std-GP. In the first approach, the models exclusively use arithmetical operators, while in the second approach, the models also use the logical IF-THEN-ELSE operators. In  [27], the authors use GP models to study the patterns of total phosphorus in Tampa Bay, Florida. In this work, GP models are trained to estimate the changing levels of total phosphorus in the bay and, after validation, are used to generate the map to be studied. In  [19], the authors use the EPR algorithm to predict the number of pipe failures in water distribution systems from their attributes.
Some authors used the ENC and ENH datasets  [119] to benchmark their methods  (MRGP  [6], MGP  [64], FEAT  [65], EPLEX and EPLEX-1M  [63] and GSGP  [25]). These are regression datasets to predict the energy performance of the residential buildings for cooling  (ENC) and heating  (ENH).
Finally, in  [113], the authors use GP to build interpretable modelsto predict global mean temperatures. Their results suggest that GP can evolve interpretable modelsthat are comparable to complex climate systems, even without resorting to historical data when making predictions.
19.6 Classification Tasks in Environmental Science
In classification tasks, the machine learning model has to associate each sample in a dataset with a nominal label. For example, a model trained to detect burnt areas should associate each dataset sample with the label “Burnt” or “Non-burnt”. Classification includes two categories: binary classification and multiclass classification. In binary classification, the model has to associate the sample with one of two classes. This task is usually considered simple. Regression models can also perform binary classification by defining a threshold that separates both classes. In multiclass classification, the model has to associate the sample with one of three or more classes.
19.6.1 Binary Classification
Std-GP and other GP algorithms are some of the popular choices for binary classification tasks. These algorithms are used to detect riparian zones using mixed data from two satellites  [76], to detect water in cloudy satellite images  [18], burnt areas in satellite images  [15, 17, 21, 100, 107, 111, 112], to separate forest from savanna  [4], and to identify cropland in high-resolution satellite imagery[37, 123]. Binary classification in remote sensingcan often be associated with detecting a specific land cover type, as seen in Fig.  19.5, where a GP model is used to detect burnt areas  [17]. GP algorithms can also be applied to high-resolution UAVimagery. In  [69], the authors apply the Std-GP algorithm to an image segmentation problem to detect algae in river images obtained using a sensor onboard a UAV
Fig. 19.5
Landsat-8 satellite imagery, obtained over the state of Pará  (Brazil) in August 2015. The red areas marked in  bhighlight the areas classified as “burnt” by the machine learning model
Outside the remote sensingarea, Std-GP is used for the prediction of production errors in the steel industry  [74]. Although this is not a direct application in environmental science, the authors state that a higher success rate in production results in lower energy requirements, which leads to fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Other authors apply GP  [70] and GA  [124] algorithms to the prediction of traffic congestion.
One of the advantages of using GP-based methods to detect specific classes is the flexibilityof the application of the features produced. In  [18], the authors compare the application of water detection indices  [88] with those evolved by the Std-GP in a dataset that includes many pixels from cloudy locations. The authors conclude that the evolved features are better than some human-made indices and equally good to others. From a practical point of view, the features evolved by  [76] can be considered indices to detect riparian zones. This statement implies that GP can produce indices that detect highly difficult land cover types, in opposition to detecting water and burnt areas.
Regression algorithms  (e.g., Std-GP) usually produce a model equivalent to a mathematical expression. Since their output is numerical, it requires a final post-processing to perform binary classification. The typical approach is the use of a threshold that separates the two classes, as seen in  [18, 100]. Since the classes are nominal and usually do not have an order, this approach is often not applicable to multiclass classification. An exception to this rule may be the discrimination between classes that are related to each other, e.g., barren areas, grasslands, and forests. In this example, we know that the classes have different biomass volumes, which can be used to easily order and classify the samples by using multiple thresholds  [50].
19.6.2 Multiclass Classification
Multiclass classificationis considered a more complex task, and two main approaches exist to solve it. The more direct option is to use a classifier that can perform multiclass classificationby separating all classes at once, using a single model. However, these models are usually complex. Experts may decide to decompose a multiclass problem into several simpler, binary classification problems. There are multiple ways of doing this. The most common approach is the one-versus-all  [110] strategy. This approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategywith an n-class problem divided into several binary classification problems. As exemplified in Fig.  19.6, the one-versus-all strategy performs a succession of binary classifications until the correct class is identified.
Fig. 19.6
One-versus-all strategy for multiclass classification. In this example, the prediction is made using, at most, three classifiers
Some works apply this divide-and-conquer strategyto solve classification problems. In  [110], the authors study a dataset obtained from sonar data to identify five types of seafloor habitats. By applying the one-versus-all strategy, the authors use four models to first separate sand from other habitats, then reef, then algae, and lastly to separate the australisand sinuosaseagrasses. In  [32], the authors separate several species of vines by applying several methods, including Std-GP, using time seriesdata that measure the intensity of fluorescence emissions using the Kautsky effect  [58].
Many recent works focus on the application of multiclass classificationmodels, leading to a simpler pipeline. In  [24], the authors apply the Std-GP and GSGP algorithms for several multiclass datasets, including two datasets to detect land cover types. Although the GSGP produces better scores, both methods have low accuracy in a dataset containing land cover types in agroforest mosaics, reinforcing the difficulty of identifying plantations in agroforest land cover types. In  [71], the authors propose the SAE-MOEA/D algorithm and use it to identify from three to five classes in several radar images from different sensors. In  [12], the authors use a multi-objective GA algorithm (NSGA-II  [33]) toidentify croplands in satellite imagery. In  [75], the authors propose a novel GP-based approach to evolve multiple features, testing it on a multiclass time seriesdataset. The evolved features are tested with several classifiers and the results indicate that these features are more robust than the traditional remote sensingindices developed by experts. In  [17], the authors use the M3GP algorithm to detect burnt forest areas in satellite images. This algorithm created models that reduce the dimensionality of the problem from 10 features to 3 features. Besides increasing the accuracy of the machine learning models, this allowed the visualization of the new dataset in a 3D space. In  [15], the authors use the M3GP algorithm in several remote sensingdatasets for binary classification  (detection of burnt areas) and multiclass classification(land cover type classification). The multiclass datasets included, among other classes, three subtypes of forest in satellite imagery. While most classes were easily separable, forest classes are often misclassified due to their spectral similarity. In this work, the authors compare the results from feature constructionusing M3GP with manual feature construction(i.e., using indices) and automatic feature constructionusing EFS  [7] and the non-EML Fast Function Extraction  (FFX)  [80] algorithm. However, the automatic methods were limited to binary classification datasets. In  [16], the authors use the M3GP in a multiclass time seriesdataset that includes, among other classes, two land cover types with similar spectral signatures, “natural forest” and “cocoa agroforest”. Since cocoa trees are planted in the shade of natural trees, the classes are nearly identical from the (optical) satellite point of view. Based on the analysis of the models and the frequency of selection of each feature, the authors conclude that, although the confusion matrices reveal some confusion between these classes, the features obtained in August are useful to detect cocoa. In  [15], the authors use a group of classification datasets to benchmark their approach. The work includes two datasets related to the separation of land cover types that several authors have used as a benchmark to test their algorithms, such as the M2GP  [54], the eM3GP  [109], the M3GP  [85, 86], and the M4GP  [66].
In  [13], the authors use a PSO-based algorithm to identify six land cover types in a UAVimagery dataset. Other recent works also apply EML-based algorithms to classification in high-resolution aerial imagery with applications such as the identification of multiclass land cover-type detection using an evolutionary neural architecture search algorithm  [20] and several EML algorithms  [51, 106], and also to the detection of mistletoe using a GP-based approach  [82].
19.7 Other Tasks in Environmental Science
Besides applying EML models to regression and classification problems, other authors apply EML methods to image alignmentand parameter tuning.
Regarding image alignment, in  [125], the authors propose LMACO  (Multi-modal continuous ACO with Local search), an ACO-based algorithm that allows multiple images to be stacked automatically. The LMACO method outperforms other EML-based methods such as Comprehensive Learning PSO  (CLPSO), Self-adaptive Differential Evolution  (SaDE)  [92], and the traditional ACO. According to the authors, this method can also be applied to image fusion, object recognition, and change detection.
Another popular application of EML-based models is parameter tuning. The objective of this task is to search for optimal parameters that maximize another algorithm’s robustness. In  [104], the authors use GA to tune the gain parameters on a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) to improve the amount of wind energy that is harvestable in their system. In  [71], the authors propose a MOEA-based method that automatically finds sets of parameters and hyper-parameters to be used by stacked autoencodersin the classification of land cover types in PolSAR imagery.
In  [45], the authors compare several EML and non-EML algorithms when predicting solar radiation. The main algorithms to solve this task are the Extreme Learning Machine  (ELM), ANNs, Support Vector Regressors  (SVR)  [10], and the Multi-Gene GP  (MGGP)  [36] algorithms. However, except for MGGP, these algorithms rely on other methods for optimization. The authors use three versions of the ELM algorithm: the basic version, the online sequential ELM, and optimization using SaDE. The authors also use two versions of ANNs, where the weights are evolved using either the PSO or the GA. Lastly, the authors use three versions of the SVR, where some hyperparameters are picked using either grid search or PSO or GA. Other authors also apply ANNs to predict solar power  [9] while using GA to optimize the model’s weights and biases.
In  [3], the authors use a GA-based algorithm to find an optimal set of parameters  (optimal quantity of several nutrients) to be used for crop production. When compared to the traditional approach, the GA approach improved soil fertility, increasing the production of the crops in the study area.
19.8 Robustness of EML models
One of the known issues in remote sensingdata is the radiometric variations across images caused by the presence of shadows, clouds, and moisture on the soil, among others. Consequently, machine learning algorithms may learn to identify a class based on a temporary characteristic or noise. This overfitting to the characteristics of a particular image may result in the model failing to detect the correct land cover types when given a different image.
Some works comment on the robustness of their models by applying them to different satellite images  [16, 17] or different sensors  [31]. In  [31], the authors use GA to evolve the weights of an expression to simulate the NDVI index using visible wavelengths. This expression is applied to data from two quadcopters with different sensors  (Matrice 210 and Phantom 4 Pro+), showing that this expression provides good results in multiple sensors with minimal input from the user. In  [17], the authors use three burnt area detection datasets that were obtained from three different countries with different characteristics. Each of these datasets has training and test samples. The authors notice that if a model is trained in one dataset, although it has a very high test accuracy in the respective test set, the accuracy is reduced when applying the model to datasets from different locations. In an attempt to mitigate this lack of transferability, the authors show that several classification algorithms are more robust when trained using features evolved by the M3GP algorithm. Another approach used by the authors is to train models using samples from multiple datasets. In  [16], the authors test the robustness of their algorithm by validating the models in an area much larger than the one used during the model’s training phase. In that work, the lack of transferabilityis more evident in the non-EML classifiers that, while achieving higher accuracy values on the test set, are surpassed by the M3GP-based approaches when applied to the validation set.
In most environmental science applications, humans are the ones responsible for labeling samples in datasets. Still, datasets are prone to containing mislabeled samples, leading to imperfect datasets. If the machine learning algorithms are unable to identify mislabeled samples, the model will learn the incorrect labels, overfitting this erroneous data. In  [111], the authors use a semi-supervised GP-based method that is able to ignore mislabeled samples by making use of unlabeled data together with the labeled set.
19.9 Examples of Human-Competitiveness
Over the years, EML algorithms produced human-competitive results in various applications from different research fields, including environmental science  [59]. John R. Koza surveyed a large section of these works in 2010  [62] and, while this survey only contains works until 2009, other works can be seen in the “Humies” Awards website  [53]. This award is given in a competition recognizing human-competitive results produced by genetic and evolutionary computation. Besides the winners, the website also displays the work of the other applicants. This includes recent applications in environmental science and the EML methods used, such as the use of NSGA-IIand Evolutionary Strategies  (ES) in traffic light optimization  [105] and for traffic flow optimization  [114] using Green Swarm, a method-based on (10+2)-EA  [116]. Other applications include predicting soil moisture using interpretable models  [14] obtained from differential evolution and GAs, and the use of GP to predict wind damage  [48].

The centroidsof the clusters are marked in black and highlighted in green. This image shows in a clear way that the “non-burnt” cluster should be split into two clusters. 
Image source[17]
As stated in the feature constructionSect.  19.4, machine learning experts spend a long time in feature engineering[35]. Although this task requires domain-specific knowledge, many automatic methods are being produced, simplifying this task. In this section, we follow the work of Batista et al., using their work as an example of human-competitivenessin automatic feature constructionfor remote sensingdata. This is an extension of some of their work on the detection of burnt areas  [17], separation of forest subtypes  [15], separation of land cover types with nearly identical spectral signatures  [16] and detection of water in cloudy satellite images  [18].
In  [17], the authors use the M3GP algorithm to evolve a set of robust features to detect burnt areas. In some cases, only three features were produced, which allowed the visualization of the new feature space in a 3D space, as shown in Fig.  19.7. These features were then directly applied to satellite images in order to understand what the models are “seeing” when classifying pixels, and it was noticed that some of the evolved features have a particular meaning. When applying the features to a satellite image, the authors noticed that each feature clearly highlights a particular terrain characteristic, rather than producing a noisy map that depends on the other features to make sense. In one of the experiments, the final model contained three interpretable features. Two of those features are displayed in Eqs.  19.2and  19.3. Equation  19.2seems to highlight burnt areas, areas of low vegetation, and active fire. This statement can be justified by the use of the SWIR2 and Red bands in the equation. Equation  19.3seems to highlight burnt areas, active fires, and water. This statement can also be justified by the bands selected by the M3GP algorithm for these features. By multiplying these two features, the resulting expression visibly highlights the burnt area better than the Normalized Burn Ratio  (NBR)  [60], an index of burn developed and used by remote sensingexperts. This comparison is seen in Fig.  19.8
(19.2)
(19.3)
Fig. 19.8
Landsat-8 satellite imagery over Pará, Brazil during the 2015 wildfires. Figure ashows the RGB image; bshows the application of the NBR index to highlight burnt areas; cshows the application of the multiplication of Eqs.  19.2and  19.3. Both (b) and (c) were normalized using their maximum and minimum values of the dataset used by the authors in  [17]
In this case, the algorithm evolves features to detect burnt areas and, in  [18], to detect water. Remote sensingexperts have studied both tasks and indices to detect burnt  [60] and water  [88] exist. In  [18], Std-GP is used to evolve a single feature that detects water pixels while being robust to cloud pixels. The authors study one dataset obtained from two satellite images over the Amazon River’s delta and over Portugal. The accuracy values from five water indices are calculated and compared with the ones obtained with Std-GP. The results reveal that the evolved features are statistically better than three of the five human-made indices, and no statistically significant difference was found when comparing the results with the other two indices. Interestingly, Std-GP tends to pick the same features as those used by remote sensingexperts, suggesting it can generate similar features without domain-specific knowledge.
In  [15, 16], the M3GP algorithm evolves features that discriminate several similar land cover types  (e.g., different forest types), a task that is harder than detecting burnt or water, or even simply detecting a forest class without subtypes. In the first article  [15], several machine learning methods are used for automatic feature construction. The EFS, FFX, and M3GP algorithms are applied for binary classification  (detection of burnt areas), and only the M3GP is applied for multiclass classification(mappingof land cover types). The results obtained using these features are compared with those obtained using indices created by remote sensingexperts and without using feature constructionmethods. Given the difficulty of this multiclass classificationtask, and the fact that the M3GP-evolved features improved the generalization of the state-of-the-art classifiers, it seems clear that this kind of algorithm can compete with experts and their domain-specific knowledge in the development of indices.
In the second article  [16], the authors compare the results from several classifiers  (M3GP, multi-layer perceptron, random forest, ridge, ROCKET, and XGBoost) in three versions of a dataset containing several land cover types. One version is a uni-temporal dataset and two other versions are time-series datasets containing data from May to September. The data includes two land cover types with nearly identical spectral signatures: “forest” and “cocoa-agroforest”. Based on the positive results of using M3GP-evolved features in the previous work, the authors study the features generated by M3GP for this new task and learn that, although they do not significantly improve the results of the best classifier, M3GP frequently selects the features from August in the time seriesdata. This reveals that this particular month is relevant to solve the problem. It also highlights the feature selectioncapabilities of the M3GP algorithm.
19.10 Conclusions
This chapter reviewed the use of Evolutionary Machine Learning  (EML) in environmental science applications. The type of data used in these applications varies in several factors, such as source  (in situor remote sensing), temporality  (uni-temporal or time series)and dimensionality  (low to high number of features), and the applications include several different tasks  (regression, classification, data cleaning, feature engineering, hyper-parameter optimization, image alignment, among others). This variety of data and application types shows the flexibilityof EML.
From the papers reviewed, we observe that genetic algorithms and genetic programming have been popular choices in specific fields of environmental science. For at least three decades, genetic algorithms have been used for automatic feature selection, producing great results in high-dimensional datasets. Algorithms based on genetic programming are also popular choices for automatic feature constructionapplications. Genetic programming algorithms can be considered human-competitive since they are applied to feature construction taskswhere they outperform the experts in the field. Among the EML-based algorithms, they also seem to be a popular choice for classification tasks.
In conclusion, even though EML is still not the first choice, or regarded as state of the art, for environmental science applications, many EML-based methods have been created and used in environmental science applications over the last decades. This reveals a fairly large interest from experts in this area, most probably connected to the advantageous characteristics of EML such as robustness and interpretability
