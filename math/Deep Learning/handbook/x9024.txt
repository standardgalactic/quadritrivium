Abstract
One way to measure the impact of our field of research on finance is to analyse the adoption of evolutionary machine learning in the finance literature. In this study, we focus on articles appearing in the top-ranked journals in finance. A number of interesting observations are made including that there appears to be a trend in the adoption of evolutionary machine learning across a growing and diverse set of topics.
24.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we examine the uptake of evolutionary machine learning in the finance literature. Evolutionary machine learning involves the use of evolutionary computation for machine learning tasks including pre-processing, learning and post-processing  [1]. By evolutionary computation we include approaches such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolutionary strategies, evolutionary programming, differential evolution, etc.
Within the evolutionary computation community there has been a keen interest in the application of evolutionary computation to problems in finance, including areas such as portfolio optimisation, tradingand credit rating. There have been dedicated workshops and conference strands focussing on applications in finance, such as the EvoFIN event which was held annually at the EvoStar conferences from 2007 to 2018 with proceedings published by Springer (e.g.  [2]), the Real-World Applications track at GECCO, and at IEEE CEC track on Finance and Economics. There have also been a number of books and edited books (e.g.  [3–13, 15]), and the GP-bibliography (http://​gpbib.​cs.​ucl.​ac.​uk/​) contains many examples of the application of Genetic Programming to finance.
It is perhaps not surprising that researchers in evolutionary computation have found the world of finance as an attractive application domain. Evolutionary computation being inspired by the adaptive process of biological evolution, and producing tools that might be capable of performing well in such environments, it seems a natural fit to the complex adaptive systems that the world of finance inhabits.
A recent study by Brabazon et al.  [14] focussed on the application of genetic programming to finance and economics, and noted the scant evidence of the uptake of genetic programming in the mainstream finance community. EC researchers tending to favour publication in computer science venues, and focussing more on method development than advances in the domain of application of finance itself. The main contribution of this study is to analyse the uptake of evolutionary machine learning in the mainstream finance literature, in order to ascertain the impact our community may be having upon the community of scholars in this application domain.
In the remainder of this chapter, we set out our approach in Sect.  24.2detailing the set of finance journals we examine, before highlighting our main findings in Sect.  24.3. We conclude the chapter with some Discussion (Sect.  24.4) and a Summary and Conclusions in Sect.  24.5
