10.6 Evolutionary Computation Aided by  Machine Learning
This section includes approaches where models are inherently evolutionary, but their functionality or performance is improved with machine learning approaches. A common example is an approach where the evolutionary model uses machine learning in their fitness assignment or one of the components of the evolutionary computation model is replaced by machine learning. Table  10.2presents examples of evolutionary generative models, which we consider to belong to the category evolutionary computation aided by machine learning. The listed publications are grouped by application domain (first column) and then sorted by year (second column) and by authors (third column).
Similar to Sect.  10.5, the use of genetic programming in this section mainly pertains to the generation of specific image classes/types [41, 127, 128, 134, 143, 195, 209] or to aesthetic imagery [12, 42]. In addition to this, genetic programming methods for the transformation of existing images have also been presented, such as the evolution of image pipelines by Correia et al. [45]. Machado et al. [133] and Correia et al. [42] explored the stylistic change in evolutionary artin a framework similar to GANs using an adaptive classifier along with a genetic programming engine. Similarly, Baeta et al. [10] proposed another example of a system having a competition between isolated components, where the generatorof a standard deep convolutional GAN is replaced by a genetic programming approach.
Regarding genetic algorithms for the image domain, examples of machine learning for the fitness assignment phase include the use of artificial neural networks either by evolving false positive images [156], false negatives [44] or even to perform data augmentation[32, 43]. Lopes et al. [113] and Martins et al. [144] also employed a genetic algorithm guided by a machine learning model to evolve vector graphics, and stencils for typefaces, respectively. Similar to the work by Bergen and Ross  [15] (see previous section), both modalities of fitness function (static and dynamic) were explored, the latter as a separate experiment and the former by mixing a static target function with user-defined options. Graph evolution is another example of the application of genetic programming to image generation, as exemplified by Vinhas et al. [209].
Concerning genetic programming, there are examples for the generation of melodies [96, 163], including Jazz [188], and the generation of rhythm with accompanying melodic tracks, explored by Manaris et al. [137] as well as Spector and Alpern [189]. Using genetic algorithms, many works dealt with the generation of specific parts of music such as melody [71] and rhythm [27]. Other works focussed solely on harmony generation [162], i.e. musical responses, instead of generating sound from scratch. Like in the category evolutionary computation without machine learning, automated music composition is also addressed in this section with the work of Biles et al. [17], who used artificial neural networks for fitness assignment. Although almost all examples of the application of genetic algorithms to music generationdealt with music, the broader explorationof audio, in general, was addressed by Ianigro and Bown [94].
Relating to text generation, a genetic algorithm was used by Levy [103] for the purposes of poetry generation with an artificial neural network as a measure of adaptive fitness. Other examples include the study of satire generation by Winters and Delobelle [213] and by Al-Najjar and Hämäläinen [2]. Finally, examples of other applications include the works by Liapis [108] for the evolution of colour palettes, the evolution of scene elements by Colton [36] and the introduction of a system for generating novel culinary recipes by Morris et al. [152].
In this section, most of the analysed works in terms of representation have representativity of the three types of representation but with a prevalence of the procedural ones (20 procedural, 9 descriptive and 6 parametric representations).
