24.2 EML in Finance Journals
We focus our attention on the top 50 finance journals, as determined by theFT50 list,1the Association of Business Schools (ABS) Academic Journal Guide 20212and Google Metrics.3Table  24.1lists the complete set of journals alongside which list they are members of. The membership of each list was accessed on 21 October 2022. The FT50 listcontains a set of 50 journals that are used by the Financial Times as a component of their method to rank global business schools, based on the number of publications in this list by members of the faculty in each school. By our categorisation six of the FT50 journals are in the field of finance, and these are the ones we focus on. The UKâ€™s Association of Business Schools list is based on both bibliometrics and qualitative views of a scientific committee, and ranks journals from the lowest grade of ABS1 up to the highest of ABS4*. Many of the ABS4* journals also appear in the FT50 list. While the ABS list has its origins in the UK, it is recognised by many European business schools. In this study, we focus on the higher ranked ABSjournals including ABS3, ABS4 and ABS4* listed under their category of Finance. For Google Metrics, we focus on the sub-category of Financewithin the category of Business, Economics & Management. Google Metrics ranks journals based on citation counts captured on Google Scholar, using their calculation of a 5-year h-index.
