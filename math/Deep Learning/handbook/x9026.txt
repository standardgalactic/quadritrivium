Using each journals’ online search interface, we used the following search terms to capture instances of evolutionary machine learning:
evolutionary machine learning,
evolutionary computation,
evolutionary algorithm,
genetic algorithm,
evolution strategy,
genetic programming,
differential evolution.
We have uncovered 199 papers over a period of time ranging from 1997 to 2022. The number of articles found in each journal is provided in Table  24.1and Fig.  24.1reports the number of articles published each year. There is a trend of increasing publication activity using evolutionary algorithms over the period of time, in particular, there is a marked increase in frequency since 2010, and in particular in the past 4 years since 2019. 14 of the journals examined did not have any papers published that contain evolutionary machine learning. 10 of these belong to the ABS3 list, with 2 from the ABS4 list, and the remaining 2 from the Google Metrics list. All of the FT50/ABS4* journals examined have published articles related to evolutionary machine learning.

Using the search terms provided in Sect.  24.2we have uncovered articles over a period of time starting in 1997 ranging up to the present day. The number of articles on evolutionary algorithms published each year
In the 199 articles, we count 446 distinct authors, 36 of whom have published more than one article. Figure  24.2captures the number of articles with multiple authors. The majority of articles have between two and three authors. Two articles have seven authors. Table  24.2lists the top 12 authors who have published 3 or more articles related to evolutionary machine learning in finance.

We count the number of articles for the size of each set of authors. The majority of articles have two to three authors, with two articles having seven authors

There are 36 authors who have published more than one article related to EML in Finance. Here we present authors who have published three or more articles

Figure  24.3presents a heatmap of the number of articles published each year in every journal examined. We have clustered the journals into three groups based on their relative prestige. The most prestigious journals for faculty in finance are more often considered to be those in the FT50, ABS4and ABS4 lists. The next most prestigious would be the ABS3, the remaining journals in the Google Metrics Top 20 list are grouped into the third cluster. A total of 25 articles (13% of the total captured in our analysis) have appeared in the most prestigious cluster. While there are a relatively smaller number of articles in this group they are spread out over time capturing both the earliest (1997) and most recent (2022) publications relating to EML in finance. Up to 2010 there are a total of 9 articles in this first group, with the remaining 16 articles appearing in the last decade.
Fig. 24.3
A heatmap of the number of articles published in each journal each year. The journals are clustered by perceived quality from top to bottom, with the FT50, ABS4, and ABS4 clustered as the top ranking journals, followed by ABS3, with the final cluster being the remaining journals captured by Google Metrics Top 20
142 articles appear in the second cluster of journals, which is also the largest cluster, and represents 71% of articles captured in our analysis. By far the most articles (48 equating to 24% of the total) appear in the journal Quantitative Finance. A total of 33 articles (or 17%) appear in the third cluster of journals. Note there is an overlap between some journals that appear in the Google Metrics list and those that appear in the first (5) and second (5) clusters, and as such the third cluster represents articles that appear exclusively in the Google Metrics Top 20. In contrast to the first clusters relatively even spread of articles over time, the third cluster articles all appear in the last decade (with the exception of 2, which were published earlier).
24.3 Topic analysis—Applications in Finance
We examine the topics of focus to which evolutionary machine learning has been applied to in the finance literature. We manually determine the area of application of each paper, and count the number of occurrences. We uncovered just over 40 topics.
The first article to appear in the literature in 1997 is focussed on technical analysisof foreign exchangemarketsusing genetic programming  [24]. The most recent articles appearing in 2022 focus on 14 distinct topics, including markets  [144, 187, 211], risk[88, 154, 212], futures[47, 159], insurance  [68, 138], portfolios  [146, 205], trading[23, 99], cryptocurrencies[102], pricing[35], derivatives  [196], loans[29], real estate[162], financial systems[95], mergers and acquisitions[157], and venture capital[27].

Figure  24.4provides a word cloud representation of the different topics, and Fig.  24.5presents a topic heatmap. From these figures, we observe that trading, markets, portfolios, pricingand foreign exchange are the top five topics, and represent just over of the papers found. Other topics range from mortgages, taxation, labour markets, mergers and acquisitions to securities, derivatives, real estateand cryptocurrenciesto name a few.

24.4 Discussion
Aziz et al.  [113] recently undertook a topic analysis of machine learning in finance. The method adopted was to use the Elsevier Scopus database focussing on the subject areas of 
1.
computer science;
2.
business, management and accounting;
3.
decision sciences;
4.
economics;
5.
econometrics and finance.
The publication types included both conferences and journals, and unlike this study do not focus exclusively on the mainstream finance literature. Four main categories of topics were observed in their analysis, which were Price Forecasting, Financial Market Analysis, RiskForecasting and Financial Perspectives (which include economic development). These represent an aggregation of 15 distinct topics. Interestingly research on GP and PSO was identified under their Price Forecasting topic, even though evolutionary machine learning and any of the keywords we adopted in this study were not one of the keywords used in their literature search protocol.
Our focus on evolutionary machine learning in the mainstream finance literature has uncovered a much wider set of application areas including taxation, insurance, economics, mergers and acquisitions, cryptocurrencies, etc. See Fig.  24.5for the full list. In terms of the numbers of articles, a similar trend over time is observed with a greater uptake of (evolutionary) machine learning in finance this century, in particular this past decade since around 2010.
Brabazon et al.  [14] in a recent analysis of the application of genetic programming to finance found the method applied in forecasting, trading, portfolio construction, derivatives, solvency and agent-based modelling. Also noting that much of these publications appeared in the computer science, rather than finance literature. As can be seen in this study we have uncovered that the wider set of methods encompassing evolutionary machine learning has been applied to a much more extensive set of topics in the mainstream finance literature.
Similar to Brabazon et al.  [14], Aziz et al.  [113] also note that the uptake of ML in the finance literature is significantly exceeded by the multiples of research published in the ICT (i.e. method development) literature.
