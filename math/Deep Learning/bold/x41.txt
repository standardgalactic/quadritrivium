Where Do Prizes Make Sense?
Prizes are not panaceas. Many challenges are too complicated to be prizable and others require teams to raise too much money to compete. In my experience, prizes make the most sense in the following circumstances:
1.  You have a clear understanding of your target, but not the method to get there.In the case of the Ansari XPRIZE, I knew I wanted a spaceship that could get consumers repeatedly a hundred kilometers into space. I didn’t know (or care) what type of propulsion system, landing system, or materials the vehicle would use.

2.  You have a large enough crowd of innovators to tap into.You want innovators from everywhere. Restricting entrance into a competition to smaller talent pools produces lesser results. The Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup XCHALLENGE attracted 350 teams from around the globe. Had we restricted the challenge only to students at a single university, we would never have achieved our desired goals.

3.  A small team is capable of solving the challenge.The ideal competition can be solved by a reasonably small team. In the case of the DARPA Grand Challenge for autonomous cars, it was a team of graduate students from Stanford. In the case of the Ansari XPRIZE, it was a group of thirty engineers from Scaled Composites. Projects requiring a team much larger will likely run into fund-raising and management challenges.

4.  You are flexible on timeline, types of solutions, and who might win.When using an incentive prize solution, you give up a certain amount of control in exchange for getting unexpected, potentially breakthrough results from nontraditional players. If you specify challenge parameters too narrowly—such as which technologies must be used or where the innovators should come from—you lower your chances of getting the results you seek.

5.  You are flexible on who owns the intellectual property at the end.We’ll discuss intellectual property (IP) in greater length below, but in the case of most XPRIZEs, the IP is retained by the winning team, and the prize sponsor backing the competition is doing so for the purpose of publicity or to bring real change to the world. This is not necessarily the case for HeroX challenges, where the IP can be owned at the end by the challenge sponsor.

The Big Three Motivators
As I’ve studied prizes, I’ve identified three principal motivators that attract teams to compete. Understanding these principles can help you fine-tune your competition to maximize participation.

1.  Significance/recognition.There’s a lot of latent talent that wants the chance to prove itself to the world. Prizes, especially those high in MTP and visibility, offer the winning team the chance for rapid fame.

2.  Money.While many teams don’t compete only for the money, sometimes the cash can be a real motivator. Such was the case for Dr. Paul MacCready, who designed and built the Gossamer Condor, a human-powered vehicle that flew a figure eight between two markers half a mile apart. MacCready pursued the challenge to win the £50,000 Kremer prize and pay off a personal debt.23
3.  Frustration.In many cases, such as with the Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup competition, the competing teams are deeply frustrated by the status quo and want to solve the problem. Thus competition gives them a target to shoot toward, and a way to focus their frustration.

Key Parameters for Designing Your Incentive Challenge
As you design your own incentive competition or HeroX challenge, there are fifteen important parameters to consider.

1.  Simple, measurable, and objective rules.When creating a challenge, strive for rules that are straightforward, measurable, and objective, with a finish line that makes the winning of the prize obvious to everyone. In the case of the Orteig Prize, the rules were “fly nonstop between New York and Paris.” In the case of the Ansari XPRIZE, the simple version of the rules could be expressed as “Fly the same three-person spaceship to a hundred kilometers in altitude, twice in two weeks.” Of course the detailed rules are far more complex, but good prizes are easy to explain and understand.

2.  Define the problem, not the solution.The prize rules should define a problem to be solved, not a solution to be implemented. For example, the Ansari XPRIZE did not care about launch-vehicle details (propulsion, landing mechanisms, etc.). The only objective was to get three people to 100 kilometers twice in two weeks. As a result, the competition saw over a dozen uniquely different approaches.

3.  Pick the appropriate structure.Incentive competitions come in a variety of different structures. Here’s a list of a few variants worth considering. Find one that is best for you:
•  Past the post. This type of competition offers cash to the first team to achieve the set goal.

•  Past the post with a deadline. This is how we structured the Ansari XPRIZE. We offered up $10 million for the first person to fly twice to a hundred kilometers altitude beforeDecember 31, 2004.

•  Bake-off. This is most similar to the Olympic Games. A bake-off competition takes place on a certain date, where teams compete head-to-head, and the best performance in the competition is awarded the purse.

•  Bake-off with a minimum performance threshold. This is how we structured the Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup XCHALLENGE. Teams delivered their hardware to the same location and competed head-to-head. The best performing team, above a minimum performance (2,500 gallons per minute of oil cleaned up), won the competition.

4.  Addressing market failures.Incentive competitions are often needed to jump-start a stuck industry and demonstrate a new market. Prizes should address problems where a market failure prevents solutions. Here are a few examples of common types of market failures:
•  People believe a problem is not solvable. There is institutional and public misperception.

•  There is a stigma that prevents people from even attempting to solve the problem.

•  Entrenched players or unions prevent fair competition or transformation of the industry or technology.

•  Capital is not flowing into an important problem area.

•  Regulatory structures prevent the innovation from materializing.

5.  The proper balance of audacity and achievability.The prize needs to be audacious enough that it is inspirational (i.e., has an MTP), but not so difficult that it can’t be achieved. When I originally announced that the goal of the Ansari XPRIZE was a suborbital flight to a hundred kilometers, many criticized the competition, arguing the target should be private flight into Earth orbit. Had the latter been the objective, it’s unlikely that the competition would have been won (energy-wise, orbit is fifty times harder than a suborbital hop to a hundred kilometers). In other words, suborbital flight was sufficiently audacious and achievable—we didn’t need to go further to change the paradigm.

6.  Purse size. Purses come in all sizes. A typical XPRIZE purse runs from $2 million to $30 million, while the average HeroX challenge ranges from $10,000 to $1 million. The size of the purse depends on a number of variables: an understanding of the incentive needed to encourage action, the value of the back-end marketplace, the minimum amount needed to attempt the feat (i.e., a purse might be sized according to the minimum expected that a team might spend), the perceived importance of the problem, and the sponsors’ desire for branding (the “biggest ever”). Teams are typically willing to invest more than the amount of the purse if the competition has a back-end business model that allows them to recoup their investment. In the case of higher-end prizes, the large prize purse (for example, $10 million) is used to break through the media clutter, raise the visibility of a problem, and attract nontraditional players.
