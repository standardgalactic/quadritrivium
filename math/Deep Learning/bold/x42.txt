This consistent attention attracts funders, builds community, and helps produce the desired change in mindset. In the case of the Ansari XPRIZE, the competition required a pair of flights over two weeks. Teams got far more exposure than would have been the case if the competition simply required one flight on a single day. The best prize designs keep the conversation alive from start to finish.

8.  A telegenic and captivating finish.Competitions with telegenic finishes—that is, a finish that is extremely visually compelling—will help drive media attention, which, in turn, drives teams to spend more time and money in their attempts to win (everyone wants to be famous). Such a finish also drives media impressions, which educate the public about the change created.

9.  Multiple purses and bonuses.Using multiple purses (e.g., second and third place) and “bonus” purses can increase the number of teams competing and the variety of approaches pursued. Secondary purses can keep teams engaged even if there is a strong front runner, and keep teams competing after first place has been awarded. It can also lengthen the time of the competition, thereby increasing its ability to achieve paradigm change.

10.  Launching above the line of super-credibility.The initial announcement of your challenge should be highly visible and super-credible. The launch should drive maximum media exposure, both publicizing the prize and its sponsors and ensuring that the competition is taken seriously from the start. Properly done, a super-credible launch changes the public’s perception of the challenge from “Can it be done?” to “When will it happen and who will win?” At the launch event, it is important to have the participation of gold-plated endorsers (who share their reputational equity) and a number of teams ready to compete.

11.  Global participation/open to all.The best incentive competitions are global in nature. In seeking the broadest range of qualified teams—independent of age, education, and experience—you maximize the opportunity for breakthrough results. In other words, don’t try to anticipate where solutions will come from. In the case of the Longitude Prize, the British Admiralty was so certain that determining longitude would come from looking at the stars, they filled the committee charged with picking the winner with astronomers. As a result, John Harrison, a watchmaker, was denied the purse for nearly a decade.

12.  Prize timelines and deadlines.The prize timeline is a function of the competition’s degree of difficulty. Smaller HeroX challenges might be awarded in six months to a year, while larger-end $10 million XPRIZEs are designed to be won in a three- to eight-year time frame. Couple an appropriate timeline with a deadline, and you’ll get increased action. The Ansari XPRIZE, launched in May of 1996, took eight years, and was won less than three months before the December 31, 2004, deadline.

13.  Ownership of intellectual property (IP) and media rights.In a typical XPRIZE, the teams retain IP and the XPF retains media rights. Other prize designs may require that the IP be made available to the public or that a portion of the IP is owned by or licensed to the prize sponsor. If the prize sponsor gets the IP in exchange for the prize purse, then it’s a commercial prize. If the IP is retained by the team or put into open domain, then the prize is considered philanthropic and the prize purse is typically tax deductible. In general, there are four variants worth considering:
•  Philanthropic.Winner retains IP.

•  Philanthropic.IP is put into open domain.

•  Commercial.IP is owned by the prize sponsor.

•  Commercial.IP is licensed (or shared) by the prize sponsor.

14.  Incorporation of a back-end business model into the prize design.The ideal competition is designed so that there is a back-end business opportunity for teams to exploit once the prize is won. For example, the Ansari XPRIZE required a three-person spaceship rather than a one-person ship. This opened the possibility of space tourism, allowing for a commercial business model that made it easier for teams to raise funding and was one of the main reasons they were willing to spend far more money than the purse in their attempts to win. When a team wins, the resulting publicity drives capital investment, deployment of the technology, market acceptance, and a new industry that produces a long-term solution to the market failure initially targeted by the competition.

15.  Writing the final set of rules.The rules are an incentive competition’s DNA—they will determine the competition’s success or failure and its validity over time. Rules that are made invalid by changing technology or political/social conditions are problematic. Rules that are naive or easily broken can lead to negative or empty results. Consider the case of Nobel laureate Richard Feynman’s famous prizes announced during his 1959 lecture “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.” Feynman offered two $1,000 prizes, one for the first person to build a working motor within a one-millimeter cube and the second for the first person to write the information from a book page on a surface 1/25,000 smaller in linear scale.24The rules for his first prize were poorly conceived. While Feynman was looking to promote nanotechnology, what he received instead was a working motor built by an enterprising graduate student using meticulous craftsman skills and conventional tools (jeweler’s tweezers and a microscope). Feynman paid the prize but didn’t achieve his goal. That said, in 1985, Tom Newman, a Stanford graduate student, successfully captured the second Feynman prize by reducing the first paragraph of A Tale of Two Citiesby 1/25,000.25

Today, the XPRIZE spends a lot of time thinking about fundamental objectives. How to achieve a goal without specifying the exact process and how to avoid a false wins (i.e., that micro-motor built from conventional tools). At the beginning of a competition, we propose a set of guidelines that are publically distributed and open for comment. There is extensive discussion with the teams and then, months later, the guidelines are converted into a final set of rules. At the unveiling of SpaceShipOne, Burt Rutan noted, “It’s amazing that the rules for the XPRIZE are still valid today, nearly eight years after they were announced in 1996.” This was an important lesson.

The Step-by-Step How-To of Your Incentive Competition
With all of the parameters above in mind, now it’s time to design, build, and launch your own challenge. The HeroX Platform can help you do this, or you can make it happen on your own. Here are the steps involved:
1.  IDEATION. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU WANT TO SOLVE?
Identify the key issue. What problem keeps you up at night? It can be technological, social, or market-based. What paradigm do you want to change via competition? What might the world look like after the prize is won? Work to identify the market failures that led to this impasse. Peel back the layers and determine what’s at the core. This ideation phase will help you to identify which parts of the problem are best to focus on solving.

2.  GUIDELINES AND METRICS. WHAT PARAMETERS ARE YOU MEASURING?
Your next step is to define the key attributes of success. What do you want teams to achieve during the competition? What does the finish line look like? What are you measuring? How will you measure it? Is it cost-free to judge your competition or labor-intensive? Is the target too audacious? How will the public (or your community) perceive the objective you set?
3.  THE OTHER DETAILS: NAME, PURSE, DURATION, AND IP
•  Name. What will you name your challenge? You’re looking for something recognizable, easy to remember, cool, and snappy—something that captures the essence of the competition and spreads virally.

•  Prize purse.How big will you make your purse? How much is the solution to this problem worth? The goal is a purse large enough to attract innovators, but not so large that it encourages the old guard to compete. The right purse is typically enough to cover the baseline costs an innovative team might spend. Also, if you’re short on cash, crowdfunding is an option, but be sure to choose a prize name, objective, and MTP that motivates your community to contribute.

•  Duration and format.Most prizes should have a deadline (which you always have the option to extend). How long do you think it should take to solve the problem? Remember, shorter deadlines drive greater risk taking, but deadlines that are too short can keep teams from entering. What is the best structure for your challenge? Will you award the first team to achieve a minimum threshold? Will you make it an annual competition, in which you reward the best performance each year on a certain date (think Olympics)? Each approach can bring great benefits, but each has different cost implications for operating the challenge.

•  Intellectual property.Who owns the IP at the end of your competition? If you don’t have to own it and can allow teams to retain the innovation, then you may get more teams competing. You can alternatively ask them to give you a license or put it into the public domain.

4.  POLISHING YOUR PRIZE DESIGN
Before you launch your prize, take the time for one more rules review. Here you want to optimize the competition around the following parameters:
•  Make it hard to cheat. Remember the Feynman prize example, where a graduate student built a micro-motor with tweezers. Can you improve your rules to prevent this sort of cheating or false win?
•  Examine the rules to make sure that the key indicators are sufficiently objective and measurable. Put differently, make sure you know how to pick a winner. Can your judges easily determine success, or will it require expensive and exotic equipment? Answering these questions ahead of time will save you considerable heartbreak later.

•  Have you estimated how much it will cost to run the competition? Can you figure out cheaper ways to host it, judge it, promote it?
