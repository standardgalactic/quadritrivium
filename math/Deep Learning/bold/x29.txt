If you’re considering a number of crowdfunding possibilities but are unsure which one is best, ask your community. Post your idea online (Google+, Facebook, etc.) and get feedback. You also want to pick an idea that is far enough along that people believe you’ll be able to pull it off. If your product or project is underdeveloped, people will doubt your ability to make it real, and you’re unlikely to get the support you need. On the other hand, if the product is too advanced—nearly finished and ready to ship—why would people want to back it?
2.  HOW MUCH? SETTING YOUR FUND-RAISING TARGET
So now that you’ve settled on what you want to crowdfund, the next question is, how much money do you want to raise? Here again there is a bit of psychological strategy you need to consider.

Crowdfunding is all about incentives. The success of the campaign is wholly dependent on creating early excitement and offering urgent, exclusive, and value-added incentives.

Thresholds.On many crowdfunding platforms, they allow you to run only fixed-funding campaigns—meaning you get to collect the cash only if you reach your stated fund-raising goal. Thus, the most important threshold is the amount needed to reach that goal, but this number can be tricky to estimate. For example, in 2012, Indiegogo found that, on average, campaigns that set their goal between $50,000 and $75,000 raised more money than campaigns that set their goal at $100,000.20
In a fixed-funding campaign, setting the goal too high means that even if you raise millions of dollars and excite thousands of backers, you don’t get to keep a penny. For example, Ubuntu tried to raise $32  million for a new phone on Indiegogo. While they eventually reached over $12.8 million in funding, they drastically undershot their threshold and all $12 million was returned to contributors.

So how do you set the right threshold? The first thing to remember is that crowdfunding is not where you make a profit on your project. It’s where you offset some of your expenses. Notice I said someexpenses. In most cases, you won’t crowdfund all the development costs, but you will recover a significant portion of money that might otherwise have come from investment capital or out of your own pocket.

The second important point is that everyone loves a winner. If people believe your crowdfunding campaign is likely to succeed, it will. In other words, if you appear credible and able to meet your target goal, then people are more likely to back you. Conversely, if people don’t believe you, they’ll never whip out their credit card. In fact, the research shows that campaigns that reach 30 percent of their goal have 90 percent chance of success (that is, raising the desired amount). In the case of Pebble Watch, Eric Migicovsky needed $200,000 to move forward, but he set a goal of $100,000. In the case of the ARKYD Space Telescope campaign, the cost of building and launching the space telescope was roughly $3 million, but Planetary Resources set a goal of $1 million, with the expectation that these funds would at least help offset launch costs.

The objective here is to figure out the absolute minimum amount that, if funded, would represent enough for you to move forward. When coming up with this number, it is important to remember that there are additional costs built into any crowdfunding campaign: (1) transaction fees, which include both credit card costs at 4 to 5 percent, and platform fees, which also tend to range from 4 to 5 percent; (2) the cost of fulfilling on your rewards. We’ll talk more about these later.

Stretch Goals.So once you meet your original funding goal, what motivates the crowd to keep going? That’s where a concept called stretch goals comes into play. These are objectives added to the campaign as you approach your next funding goal. In the case of ARKYD, after we had hit the $1 million campaign target, we set a stretch goal for $1.3  million, then $1.4 million, and ultimately $1.5 million. Basically, each stretch goal promised the users more ways to become involved.

3.  HOW LONG? SETTING YOUR CAMPAIGN LENGTH AND CREATING A SCHEDULE
Typical campaigns run from 30 to 120 days, though data from Indiegogo indicates that shorter campaigns (an average length of 33 to 40 days) perform better than longer campaigns.21For comparison, the Pebble Watch was a 37-day campaign, while ARKYD was 32 days and the Tesla Museum was 45 days. As you can see from the graph below (which maps funds against time), with ARKYD there was a huge spike in the beginning, a small spike in the middle (when the campaign exceeded its $1 million target), and a big spike at the end. Such drop-offs in the middle of the campaign are typical and are the reason that stretching the campaign out longer doesn’t help.

When to launch your campaign is up to you, but you should try to give the media a reason to get excited. Tying the launch to a major announcement or anniversary that turns it into a news story can help a lot.

How long will it take you to prepare? Smaller campaigns ($1,000 to $50,000) can probably be done in a month, but if you are looking to raise hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, much longer-term preparation is critical. Following is my quick overview of how to estimate this for yourself:
