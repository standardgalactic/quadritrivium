What makes this story even stranger is that Kodak knew this change was coming. Moore’s law was well established at that point, already driving the ceaseless expansion of memory storage capacity, the process that would lead to the demonetization of photography. Kodak’s engineers surely knew this. They arguably also knew about Hendy’s law—which states that the number of pixels per dollar found in digital cameras doubles every year—as the term was coined by an employee of Kodak Australia, Barry Hendy. The writing wasn’t just on the wall for Kodak—they had put it there themselves. Yet Kodak still failed to stay ahead of this curve.
