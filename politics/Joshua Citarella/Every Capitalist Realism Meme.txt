All that I want is to wake up fine
And tell me that I'm alright, that I ain't gonna die
All that I want is to hold in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out
Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh for you to cry
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times
You're not gonna get your rock bottom
Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head
And it ain't coming down
Where do I go?
Give me some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning
Maybe I'll come alive
Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh for you to cry
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times
You're not gonna hit your rock bottom
Tell my friends
I'm coming down
We'll kick it
When I hit the ground
Tell my friends
I'm coming down
We'll kick it
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh for you to cry
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh for you to cry
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Yes
Hard mais
Fast
You
Now they're gonna get you rock bottom
Thank you.
