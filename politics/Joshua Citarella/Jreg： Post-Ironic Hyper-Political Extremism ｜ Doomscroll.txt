I'm never going to concede that a robot has consciousness and if it does have
consciousness I'm gonna do everything in my power to make it suffer you're
sounding a lot like a human supremacist I am absolutely a human supremacist I
love human beings and I love our flaws and we have this desire to like get rid
of all of our flaws and just like close that gap between action and thought or
the things that make us feel pain and that is what you are you are those
contradictions you are what feels pain you should suffer and I'm gonna kill the
robots basically welcome to doom scroll I'm your host Joshua Sidarella my
guest is J reg a popular youtuber who explores online radical politics what's
the new meta for this year yeah new meta there's a new patch update you have
politics yeah okay well on the center we have reactionary centrism that's JJ
McCullough he is reacting to the excesses of the far left and the far right by
planting his his flag in the middle and being a Biden extremist or whatever now
he's a Kamala extremist sure and he'll just you know he's like ah things are
things are getting too crazy we need to just get back in the middle and these
are the this is this is one of the only groups that actually likes America
everybody else hates America hmm if we move to the left we get the balkanized
left that's what I call it it's like a bunch of separate infighting leftist
factions that can't agree with each other on anything call each other fascist sounds
like the left or revisionist or whatever then we move to the right we have the
effective accelerationist group the move movement out of the the effective
altruist group effective efficient accelerationists EAC and they're just
like tech bros Elon Musk kind of vibe like very heavily into AI AI will fix all of
our problems will develop carbon capture which is in the 2050 projection of how
much carbon we need to produce they like I just assume we're gonna invent carbon
carbon capture I hope so but yeah we'll see we'll see if that happens and worst
case scenario network states all live on Mars and as the world burns and then we
move further right we have post racial fascism this is a new this is a new meta
update Kanye West Candace Owens Nick Fuentes all these people who are like not
white advocating for fascism sneko sneko that's a good example non-white people
advocating for fascism closing the borders and because America you can't do really
do white supremacy in America well maybe you can but it's like you need to you need to get
through post racial fascism before you get to like a white ethnostate so it's like yeah
like we're like black support for Trump in 2024 versus 2016 yeah like quadruples oh wow
yeah partially because oh Andrew Tate's a good example of post racial oh sure yeah
sure these people who are not white it's the meme like who wants to be a white
supremacist everyone's raising their hand who here is actually white everyone's
like oh mixed race people are the most racist I know this firsthand so that's a
that's on the right and then I'd say there's like an anti-centrist coalition as
well the MAGA communists perhaps these are people who are trying to make a
dialectical argument between the far left and the far right JJ will just say they're far
right fair enough and there's also these maybe the guy that shot Trump is one of
these guys just like and they like nihilist accelerationism just like
everything sucks I'm literally just gonna look up who's closest to me and shoot
him based I mean bad sorry I meant to say bad bad bad no don't do that as soon as
Trump got shot I tweeted now do the other guy and it was and it's right it's still
on there because it's I can be referring to anything what it was that can be
anything but like in the context of what was going on yeah so yeah there's a
there's the horseshoe coalition there for sure and you talk about a horseshoe
coalition in terms of people who are like trying to ban tick-tock the far left and
the far right both don't want to ban tick-tock because it spreads good ideas for
both of them yeah well it's it's complicated so as we saw with the the tick-tock
ban this is you know we're rolling back a few a few months here but there was
let's say the squad adjacent left really did not want to ban tick-tock and I
would attribute that primarily to the overwhelming abundance of palace pro
Palestinian content on ticket guys I just read Osama bin Laden and turns out
he's based God in some cases there was 70 to 1 a 70 to 1 ratio between pro
Palestinian content versus pro Israel content on tick-tock so that's you know
that's a big reason why they want to keep it around and then there were other
people like Rand Paul for example who's very much like a right-wing
libertarian but he doesn't believe that the government should ban a private
company and definitely doesn't believe that they should ban certain types of
political speech yeah and so you start to see these factions that like oppose the
center consensus for different reasons but they still oppose the same piece of
legislation yeah so I think we may see things like that emerge more and more in
the future if I do have a very possible if I do have a political project it is
encouraging stuff like that to happen yeah yeah and encouraging people to look
across the aisle specifically past the people in the middle of the aisle and view
the people who are opposing the most as possible allies yeah on the most recent
meta Zionism seems to be getting nerfed yeah the the the powers of Zion that
update right yeah that's the the expansion pack yeah Zionism's out I don't I don't
like this is really a zoomer boomer divide yeah yeah the the youths is it
more of a generational divide or like a left right divide it's definitely
generational because the the young right-wing zoo like the young right-wing
people like the far right-wing people do not like Israel for some reason this is
gonna be a rough transition you recently canvassed for representative Jamal
Bowman I did what was that experience like I enjoyed it a lot I thought that the
people I canvassed with were cool I actually liked a lot of the progressive
people that I met and a lot of people were surprised that I was there like oh
drags canvassing for a political candidate and it's it's like it's actually
not that confusing based off how I see the world like he was canvassing against a
centrist who was like within the Democratic Party what I'm advocating for is you
move to the extremes and give power to the people who are like holding you
hostage right now like quote-unquote like people like the far left like we're
gonna riot if Kamala doesn't pick a centrist vice president or whatever sure
um and so I think you should go and I think I'd like to see like for example
like uh the cent the more center candidate lose so that they can elect a
further left candidate so that things actually happen things change more I'd
love to see a left-wing project 2025 that'd be that'd be hilarious I'd love to
see Bernie Sanders seal team six Donald Trump that'd be awesome um so I don't
know that was that was an obvious one for me you know Jamal Bowman wrote poems
about 9-11 jacked anti-white I've seen him bench three plates yes yeah he's a
pretty big guy anti-zog my guy so I went I went there I said a lot of eh you know
there were like there maybe there was maybe some friction between me and the
progressives they would be like AIPAC is an organization that needs to get out of
our elections and I was like yes Israel does need to get out of our election
everyone's like uncomfortable I'm like no we know what we all know what we're
talking about here mm-hmm when we first met Jews
this was a goddamn it's okay I'm Jewish I can say it when we first met you had
been visiting all sorts of political radicals in the US you've been
traveling for a little while we met we did an exhibition together yeah and you'd
been meeting a whole bunch of interesting people including some
anarcho-capitalists yeah yeah anarcho-capitalist is a member of my
studio mm-hmm in Toronto what kind of people did you meet during that trip I'm
hung out with people in Austin who were affected with altruists a lot of a
startup culture and startup culture yeah post rationalists rationalist crypto
people a lot of crypto people involved with that scene I like them a lo was was
one of them and the less wrong guy was part of that scene what else I hung out
with you guys you guys were very cool I called you guys the left
accelerationist in my head I like that term I don't know if you agree with it but
do not research do not research was cool that I'll not trip specifically I think
that those were the two main people I hung out with yeah scenes I just I'm
fascinated by internet scenes and political scenes hang out with any fascists no I
didn't hang out with any fascists what's wrong with me probably next time next
time I'll try hard probably for the best there yeah you mentioned post irony
before yeah where did you come across that term well post I didn't invent this
term post irony has been around for a long time it's me it meant the return to
sincere to return from to sincerity from an ironic position it's often
confused with metamodernism or post post-modernism I just kind of like picked
terms for them so I describe post irony as something something feels ironic but
it's actually sincere versus meta irony which is just garbled often speech from
like a young person that doesn't know what they believe that's signaling in all
directions simultaneously and has no inherent truth value to it and I kind of
do a bit of both sometimes sure yeah yeah my sense is that people will post
something to gauge the reaction of their community or maybe they want to piss
somebody off yeah and they say something that they may or may not mean but in
the process of saying that publicly they're also determining their own
belief systems in many cases yeah like I'm gonna decide what I think about this
after I gauge the reaction of my right right for like for example for me I don't
believe in anything okay is that cool do you think that's cool oh it's not cool I
mean I actually have a lot of beliefs that's right oh yeah yeah you wouldn't I
mean you would know them but I definitely have a lot of values because
having values is cool mm-hmm unless it's not in which case I don't I think it
comes from a desperation to be involved with a community desperation from not
having any friends there are some kind of overlap between post irony and irony
poisoning yeah yeah yeah I'm an irony poison zoomer mm-hmm I'm the the irony so
deeply embedded into my soul that it is my soul and oh I do that I do that sort of
intentionally as a performance art piece but it's it's real it's true and
describes a lot of people and maybe you can move through the irony poisoning and
come up the other side with a real political perspective that helps destroy the
US government so I'm all for it I think of I think of a lot of these post ironic
belief systems this like irony poisoning process as being symptomatic of not having
like large grand narratives meta narratives that explain the world to you in this this
day and age right like we're living after the end of history there's not like a real
competing system to global capitalism socialism didn't work fascism didn't work and so it's
like well what what can you really believe in there's no alternative right and so people
tend to use this process of kind of like dipping their toe into the pool and then trying
to test out different belief systems yeah like they're playing characters in an MMORPG yeah I mean
do I feel like the wizard or do I feel like a warrior it's useful for young people you talk
about this identity play but that's maybe it's not that crazy what what the kids are doing there's
trying on a bunch different perspectives seeing which one works you know it used to be you you
wouldn't have that many options to choose from now you go on pull cump ball wiki and you sort through
all of the different ideology balls and you find which whichever ideology ball resonates with you the
most and then you live that out for a bit maybe you run into some complications or contradictions
with it and then you pick another ideology ball and eventually you pick one and then you get my
political journey and you get you know the political compass like you're all over the political
compass how old are you 16 16 year olds have lived so many lives yeah I mean there was one a famous one
that was going viral on Twitter last week that was like yeah I think of myself back in 2018 when I
was like a libertarian monarchist whatever bullshit and like the next comment is like you were 10 years
old in 2018 you were 10 years old in 2018 what are you talking about yeah now you're now you're 15
who do you think is winning who's winning of all these different groups yeah uh well I think the
centrists are definitely losing that's all I can say um I think I don't know I'm I'm sympathetic
towards that libertarian patchwork state idea because it allows for all these different ideologies to
somewhat coexist I don't think I don't know if that'll work but I'm sympathetic to all the ideas all
these ideas simultaneously I'm sympathetic to people who want to bring everyone together under a
communist state I'm sympathetic towards people who want to do just bring power back to local
communities what about what about in the world of memetics rather than like real world politics
who's like memetically winning yeah because I would say like you know 2016 to 18 was like you know there
was a huge movement from the online right and they they were winning they were dominating the discourse
all of the think pieces the narratives that were being written were in response to what they were doing
and then there was another period where you know those people waned proportionally in their influence
and I would say that in the last few I don't know last few years maybe uh definitely this summer
there's a feeling of like the tankies the authoritarian left is very prominent is on the rise now yeah yeah
I I think uh well we were just at this off left party right uh a lot of tankies there well it was an
off something party off something yeah for sure I don't know um who's winning the center is losing I can
say that with absolute confidence the Overton window has shattered down the middle and now the
center is no longer in the Overton window it's it's weird to be someone like J.J. McCullough
who thinks that uh you can be a centrist still no one likes centrists anymore he's going like this
but uh you know the uh the the further left and the further right are both getting legitimized more
and more they will continue to get legitimized more and more as things get worse this is all because
of climate change nothing else uh and the internet and wait no hold on I have to have to get my theory
of everything down okay I'm I'm zoning in on climate change just climate change now uh as that gets
worse you'll see things it's hot today huh yeah yeah nothing else matters it is I think it was the
hottest day on record two days ago nothing else matters besides that that's everything that's
basically every other week is the hottest day on record yes exactly and it's only going to get worse
and worse yeah and uh as things get worse extremism like people is as this as the failures of the
status quo continue to gather up there's always going to be these people searching for solutions
right and it's going to be harder and harder to justify the way things are as things get worse
you know as things get worse people you know understandably seek out other solutions yeah and
so who's offering solutions on the internet it's all of these political radicals from every corner
yeah exactly yeah we're hungry we're hungry for big big solutions and you know the west has fallen
uh I saw eight dollar grapes in New York the west has fallen that's what did it it's over eight dollar
grapes pack it up and it was a little it was a little thing of grapes just a little thing so you
know pack it up the west it's over go back to your mother it's over the west has a negative
tilt the negative tilt of the west I imagine all of America just packing it up like folding in
and then going home back to Europe are things getting better or worse for most people are
things getting better or worse worse worse worse worse worse obviously I'm going to say worse
there's very few situations where you can ask me are things getting better or worse for
and then fill in the blanks I'm always going to say worse I'm pessimaxed I'm a pessimaxed
neurotic pilled doom cell going despair core if one's goal was revolution and overthrow of the
government one might say that things are getting better because the conditions for that seem to be
increasing in the last few years that's true yes but for in order to things for things to get
better they have to first get worse and by that I mean once things get worse they'll just continue
to get worse and I don't really I'm just kind of leading them down the worse direction for a little
bit and they're like things get better now right I'm like no no no no no no no things get things
will get worse and worse and worse uh but there will be some fun to be had as things get worse
perhaps you have one of the most unusual audiences maybe in the entire world that's there are political
radicals from all sides that are watching your content a lot of people who disagree on basically
everything under the sun are in the same comment thread and they are avid consumers of your
content they're fans of what you do do you have an idea of who your average viewer is that's a good
question uh you know I've been through many eras on my channel I've talked about politics just only
politics and I've talked about like mental health and then I've talked about like talked about all
kinds of things gender and uh I've talked about fetishes and uh if there is a link between any of the
things I talk about it's probably whatever the internet's done to people's brains especially young
people um and you know it doesn't matter if you're if you're a communist or those other guys right
they you're still you still probably got there from being on the internet a lot and not having a lot of
real world connections and opportunities most likely so if I had to generalize my audience I'd say
probably uh autismo phrenic anti-centrist people but there's also some some centrists who think I'm
joking some normal people and they're like that's wacky that's crazy man but those those aren't my
people those those people get weeded out pretty quick one is tempted to say that the thing that
they have most in common is this instinct to categorize infinitely granular is that what yeah
internet brain I was going to call it I'm going to call it autism too many tabs open yeah um the the
desire to to I think there's a real desire to make sense of the world yeah we both also have this to
a large degree right like we're looking at people who do this to an absurd like satirical like
unimaginable degree but we're also both huge fans of this stuff like I think to myself that I know
every single type of libertarian that exists I just like I catalog them like pokemon
minor kissed hoppian anarcho-capitalist libertarian monarchist there's so many kinds and they just keep
going going georgist georgism hoppian hoppian night watchman state night watchman state
agorist agorist there's uh an infinite numbers of uh ice cream flavors for all of these post right
is there some kind of similarity that also emerges between these groups where they're cataloging
different internet subcultures in a similar way like they're fans of music and one person might be a
fan of like screamo and the other person is a fan of pop music or whatever but they both have these
enormous archives right they have everything indexed and keyworded and and has all the like meta tags and
everything is there a similar kind of impulse that has like a downstream political effect the music
categorization people they're working off of a similar sort of impulse to try to understand the
field that they're in right by categorizing everything and I could see there being like music balls in the
same way there's like ideology balls and country balls at some point like the screamo ball is like
and then you know the post-pop hard rock ball is saying some other shit I don't know I don't know
much about music but uh yeah I I would assume I would assume so we talked about the origins of the
political compass and uh what is widely considered you know a few years ago when it was first getting
popular on mainstream social media for the first time a lot of people said that it had a right
libertarian bias yeah right um I think I think uh the idea is yeah because it was made by libertarians
indeed it was yeah um although I think I think generally it has a libertarian bias in general like
there's a lot of people that come out as left libertarian very few people come out as authoritarian
um and I think I think uh the political compass making left libertarian a thing legitimizes
left libertarianism as an idea which is you know that's fine by me not by me but uh that's okay to each their own
do you think that there's a kind of meta frame around some of these things where taking these
quizzes and finding these infinitely niche granular political ideologies that uh one might infer that
this is a project designed to inflame the narcissism of small differences such that if someone is a few
blocks away from you but in the same political quadrant you can no longer have a coalition with
them you have to fight out all of your differences because they're two squares away from you yeah the
question is does this let lead to more division or more opportunities for people to connect right
and I think it does a little bit of both I think you can make both arguments I'm not really sure which
one happens more for example um the authoritarians this is a comment thread that is on your podcast
right um the marxist leninists collaborating with the fascists because they're all on the
authoritarian side of the political compass is that a kind of natural alliance that would have
happened in the past I mean maybe red brown alliance or something but it as well as creating
the narcissism of small differences and being a tool for people to create these infinitely granular
post-left hoppy and monarcho and primitivist um labels that make them so niche that they're unable
to organize I think it also creates um an exciting opportunity to make connections between people
and I think that's kind of what my whole anti-centrism bit is all about yes is looking for the connections
between disparate groups to try to create some sort of actionable political strategy and even if it's like a
post-ironic or you know apparently satirical perspective it's still like that's what it is
trying to find what the common ground between people is in a way that's not centrist yeah in a way that's
not just affirming the status quo I mean you were telling me about this this libertarian guy you can
cut this but who the libertarian guy who was running sovereign house or something like putting people
against each other in order to like have debates and the but the axiom of the debate was not so that you
can find a centrist middle ground but instead to inflame those tensions so everyone goes their own
separate way for nefarious libertarian purposes that's right I find that very interesting well
yeah I mean we're we're generally taught to think of debate as like okay we're going to approach this
issue from either side and one person's going to be from the left the other's from the right and then
we're going to whittle in towards the center find the consensus points of agreement and by doing this
we will reach the truth eventually right through their disagreement uh we will find the points on which
they align and thus we'll uncover the truth right there's another way of approaching debate
where if one wanted to further libertarian exit politics in this case you would platform everyone
who has completely disagreeing irreconcilable opinions to inflame those differences such that
the groups feel like well we can't reach a consensus there is no truth that is shared between the mass
public and we have to separate into either different competing countries or different competing parties or
whatever and so um that that kind of discursive component of debate of like trying to reach the
truth through deliberation through uh supporting your arguments all of that kind of goes out the window and
it seems to me that social media is very much designed to inflame those antagonisms and it's not
designed in such a way that we're going to platform everyone to get closer to the truth we're going to
platform everyone to inflame the differences and then break down any form of consensus reality and that's a good
thing and that's a good thing and i think that this also is like this is the ideological design of the
political compass where who is is it david nolan what is the guy's name yeah david nolan yeah yeah
the nolan chart the original like world's smallest political quiz right so this is 1967 where you take
this quiz and then it spits you out in one of the four quadrants and then in 1972 he's one of the co-founders
of the uh libertarian party in the united states and so i'm tempted to kind of like read this in reverse
that what he wants to do is to like isolate everyone as an individual who cannot be a member
of a group or a political party or any coalition because they all have to pursue their own individual
interests such that there are no yes yeah yeah well i mean very much like i would say anti-coalition
anti-political party such that all of society is composed of individuals i'm recalling margaret
thatcher in this case so that would be i would extrapolate that so the political compass is a
neoliberal psyop meant to keep us atomized and individuated uh what i'll say about the political
compass in terms of whether it's divisionary whether it makes more divisions or it like unites people
is there's a world where these increasingly fractionated political labels do divide people
there's also a world where people get together and they come to common consensus about how things
need to change uh maybe it's just we need to something broad like we need to get money out of
politics or maybe it's like we need to uh do some assassinations or something i don't know
and whatever people agree on maybe they go for that and maybe we don't fractionate into a bunch of
microstates but we all learn to live with each other's differences and get along as long as we
kill jj mccullough so so the end goal of politics is to have a dynamic and competitive marketplace for
assassinations on the deep web maybe i don't know i don't how did you find out about all this stuff
how did you ruin your life on the how did i ruin my life well uh i was uh an up-and-coming youtube
guy trying to make it on the on the internet and i've been making spoken word poetry for a while
but i was trying a bunch of different formats i tried video essays uh i at some point i read
your well i read a few things i read angela nagel's kill all normies and i read your post left pdf and
the post left pdf really captured my imagination and so i was looking into these political compass memes and
stuff and i in my in an attempt to learn about this i made a rap uh where i was all the different
political characters and uh that was just spoken word with a really shitty beat and that became a
big video for me and when you find something on the internet that works for you you just keep
doing it over and over again until uh you fall into the niche and rot away and everyone forgets you
so that's what i was that's that was my game plan there that's uh yeah i think of you um
as you said doing the uh the tiktok video of the anarcho anarcho-capitalist reviewing the ford
one f-150 it's not capitalist enough yeah exactly what would the communists think of
kellogg's cereal what's not communist enough what year was one million views on tiktok if i did that
shit literally literally yeah yeah what year was that video the 2019 five years ago now five years
an old man on the internet and in that time of those five years right because i remember seeing
all of these flourishing internet subcultures and it was to be fair it was hilarious like this stuff
these memes were so funny these cultures were so captivating and then within like the last few years
i mean you see this mounting and it's like an increasing curve it feels like a lot of these things
went from being ironic jokes on the internet to being like somehow very real and now there's like
irl groups there's meetups there's like new political parties being formed like does that
track with your understanding of these spaces that we've kind of moved into a new era here yeah when
you interview jj tomorrow he'll tell you all this internet nonsense will not do anything and will
never manifest in any kind of change whatsoever but actually um you know they start off ironic and
they become what i call post ironic where they are manifesting as sincerity they feel ironic because
they're so outside the overton window and they start gathering together meeting up these people want
community they want to actually do stuff and almost in this nihilism of wanting to just feeling like
you can't do anything about the current system you accidentally end up doing stuff uh and then
these nihilists are like no i didn't mean to do anything that was a mistake yeah but uh i think
you'll see more and more of the uh internet manifesting in reality all this weird internet politics
and i'm going to be in the jeff bezos micro state i think i gotta say that's a pretty good one
yeah yeah you get the whole foods you get twitch you get amazon and you get the washington post all
in one subscription they also have health care now have you seen this amazon health care no i gotta say
in the united states it's pretty affordable wow it's like telehealth and it's it's like tens of
dollars a month wow which is you know below market rate for a lot of these things i'm not sure if it's
vc funded or why it's so affordable right now but like that's a full like total stack you know you've got
your food you've got your news you got your media now you got your doctor it's uh it's pretty
compelling this is me reading the washington post in a world where washington no longer exists because
we're a bunch of competing futile micro states wow yeah the internet is an incredibly noisy space
right imagine you're a young person you're 15 years old and you just apparently see uh it can be it can
induce a lot of mental health problems for sure you you go out onto the internet you notice that there's
downward mobility you don't have a lot of positive prospects the background as you mentioned like the
kind of rising action to all of this especially generationally speaking is the looming threat of
climate change which is like biblical catastrophes it's literally the end of the world in some cases
and so you got onto the internet seeking out solutions or answers to this and you encounter a lot
of different views and a lot of those people who are maybe have unconventional belief systems some of
them are crazy some of them are really sane how do you tell these people apart how do you tell the
lunatics on the internet from the normal people i have a pretty good system for so if someone's saying
like you know reasonable well measured things that means they're a normal person not a lunatic i write
them off and then i go and i gravitate towards the lunatics i'm a lunatic yeah yeah i'm insane okay um i'm not
going to pretend to be a sane person and i like insane people so i i gravitate towards them and you can
you can just tell you can you can tell like people with like really esoteric views have you heard of
yakub i'm i'm yakub pilled now he created white people yes yeah um so that's what i'm into right
now i'm uh i'm yakub pilled that's my thing uh but i'm also thinking i'm also thinking of getting
into that jewish cult where they think that the rabbi is still alive that rabbi guy that's that might be
my next thing when you encounter these radical ideas online right we've both spent many years looking
over all sorts of different communities do you ever do you hold those things with you forever
some things break my brain yeah i feel like i when i'm when you're categorizing it's like putting a
book on on the library bookshelf and most of the time it's just like okay i'm just enhancing my
knowledge nothing really changes but then you learn about accelerationism and then i cannot stop using
word techno capital you do yeah yeah yeah you are accelerating towards a techno capital singularity
using it so frequently yeah exactly yes um so that's one of those things when i learned about
accelerationism viewing human beings as like a process that's just bringing about something
bigger than itself that's one of those things that really like stuck in my head as a frame yeah um as i
was as i was searching for things but mostly it's just putting a book on a bookshelf and that's it
yeah did you ever uh regret learning something online coming in contact with a belief system that you
wish you didn't know about i wish i uh had a time machine and i went back and i was like don't look
at the political conference don't do it yeah yeah i'm like but what about post left by joshua citarella
and instagram and politigram like no especially not that no i don't i don't know if i have any huge
regrets i mean um obviously uh you learn some things you learn some perspectives that make you feel
weird or or sad and then um you know it really it really just none of it matters what about love
yeah yeah no i mean i i i really think of this uh a lot right it's like there's definitely an aspect
for everyone who gets really deep into these communities where they're exploring like the
world outside themselves yeah right and a lot of those things come from like internal crises that are
very difficult to resolve and so it's kind of easier to just consume all of the knowledge in the
world and become an expert on the most esoteric topics that have no fucking applicability to the
world whatsoever yes right like the amount of like insane neocast system ideology like weird ritual
bullshit that i don't even want to say on the podcast like i have just i've cataloged all of this
in my brain like i just read all of the internet books that i saw in memes and i was like i'm gonna
learn something really important here yeah and uh the importance how would my life have been if i
didn't do that maybe it would have been fine the importance of all these things is that it lets you
get into communities we're both on the same page that like these silly internet things are going to
amount to something yeah and in rare instances people who like i mean just in the last few weeks
there are people who are like extremely marginal figures on the internet then blew up to be twitter
celebrities and are now speaking at the un yeah like we're watching a process that may take a decade
for all these things to play out but we're watching the formation of new political parties yeah we're
watching people who are you know have internet audiences find their way into mainstream politics
and those things are going to have a kind of slow process of building new political factions i would
say that's that's my opinion on it jj might disagree yeah but i look at this as being a 21st century
media experiment essentially where if we roll back to like the 20th century and we saw the foundation
of like radical magazines from the left right or wherever those things do have intellectuals they have
people who are involved in think tanks and downstream policy implications and we're kind of watching the
internet version of that so i want to look at all these places and kind of track the trend lines of
what's emerging and what is going to be influential soon because i really do think we're in a period of
the necessary expansion of the overton window yeah i would say that as you mentioned before there's
climate change there's the internet there's just a lot of pressures that are pushing this generation of
people to need to seek out other political solutions because the kind of center consensus seems to be
breaking down in the last few years yes the overton window is made of glass we all know it
and things get hotter what happens to glass when things get hotter it stretches that's right that's
why it's stretching to the left and the right at the same time we're and we're pulling it we're
pulling and it's hot uh yeah i think i think uh i think what you said is pretty true yeah at the same
time uh we don't live under the threat of nuclear war no we don't well actually i say that but we kind of
fucking do actually yeah we're about as close as we've been able to get in our lifetimes nukes also
melt the glass yeah my parents uh when they went to school they would um run these drills where they
would hide under their desk in case you know the russians decided to nuke the united states
cope wages are worse though yeah wages are much more hard to afford a home right boomers would pay like
a year's salary for a middle class home that's whack that doesn't exist anymore now it's a
unrepayable lifetime worth of debt yeah that definitely seems to be getting worse yeah yeah
yeah i don't know how anyone lives
why do you think the trust in the mainstream media is decreasing is trust in the mainstream
media decreasing or does just no one watch it because it's boring because like the average
cnn viewer is 67 and that was like the youngest like fox news viewers like average 70 so uh it's
probably just that no one watches it it's boring like you know when you when you watch a youtuber for a
while and you really like them and then you just get bored of their content you have to like justify
it morally by saying like the youtuber's bad or something and they get canceled five years later
after you stop watching them and you're like i always knew that person was bad i think um a lot
of things are getting canceled right now uh mainstream media canceled united states canceled but you never
get canceled when you're when you're at the top you always get canceled when you're already on the
decline so that's why we're canceling the united states because it's in decline yeah yeah it's like
we're bored of the united states you've been around too uh too much let's let's try this new guy
instead they're an easy target this is also canadians do politics sure we're just like we get bored of
trudeau and we're like all right let's get this other guy in is it good for society to have trust in
their media it's good if you uh if you think that like homogeneity and belief is good and you think
like having like a shared metanarrative is good and like having people like mostly agree with each
other on things that that when that leads to a sort of internal rot like we're seeing right now
then uh it's probably bad because you want people to start being critical of some of the systems that
we have in place um right so so a lot of people will say that mainstream media is not reformable
right it's completely captured by certain interests that are at the political center that are trying to
preserve the status quo right and so what necessarily needs to happen is a competing structure of
alternative media this means independent channels this means sub stack it means youtube and all
these different things and because those channels are uh not subject to the political interests of
the people who fund these organizations advertisers pharmaceutical industry and so on that they are more
able to pursue the truth they're more they're able to be honest narrators yes and so to to reach that
truth to like earn the trust of the public you necessarily have to go outside those mainstream channels
yeah dude russell brand is the most honest narrator right now god yeah yeah he it'll never i'll never
get over that he is the fucking voice for the capitalist realism audiobook just like god yeah what a waste
what a waste i don't know uh i think that there's probably some hegelian dialectics at play there
you see based off fuck are hegelian dialectics based off my understanding of hegelian dialectics all
right you've got the mainstream media that represents the thesis and there's this antithesis which is uh
in independent media and then they they they cancel each other out like protons like and anti-protons
and they explode and then they make some sort of synthesis between the two of them so maybe we'll see
russell brand on as the cnn anchor ever think about that there you go okay i don't know what's gonna
happen uh but uh do i do i do i buy that i don't know i think people just don't like mainstream media
because it's it's old and cringe and we're having some problems with new media but um as long as it
it all concentrates in some techno feudalist's hands i'm okay with that all the power many of the people
who post this radical stuff online they may or may not get involved in real world politics a few years
later have you seen people move between uh from posting to political action have you seen anyone
get radicalized online and then become like really active i mean i feel like it happened with me to
an extent uh actually it literally did yeah because you did a bunch of posts and then you canvassed for
a actual political candidate so yeah should remember who i'm talking to here yeah yeah i also ran for mayor
um you did so like i've done political stuff but yeah and it's not a pure larp either because i
i'm doing it with intention
i don't know i mean you see it right you see you see people you see people actually do stuff
what do you think i've seen i mean i've seen i've seen a lot of it you know i mean over the past few
years i've interviewed i don't know i can't even count how many people and some of them have gotten
involved in real world politics uh in some cases they're like practically involved in electoral
politics in other cases they're in like a totally insignificant basically doesn't exist communist
organization or something like that yeah yeah it's basically a reading group and and they don't
really do much other people they make big decisions like they join the national guard
yeah example or get involved with their union yeah they organize in their workplace that's a that's a
real example there's people who uh they might choose to have children they might choose to take
certain types of jobs yeah study certain things as opposed to others so i think the people uk
rioting right now have probably got together on the internet what are the lines on which we draw
political divisions now is it culture is it class is it our media diets yeah i think uh we're going
through some politics vibe shifts political realignment have we gone from like what's realigning
uh well you know you could make the argument that like things were mostly um mostly like kind of
center left or center right for a while and now it's like more like you could make the argument
that things have moved from culture more to class you could also make the argument that things have
moved from class more to like technology maybe technology or you can make the argument this is
argument i make things have moved for away from establishment to anti-establishment yeah and that
might be the that might be the actual political realignment and i'm on the side of anti-establishment
because that's uh what gives me the most swag that i mean that sounds right to me that i mean i think a
lot of people especially with the like emergence of uh right-wing populism across like basically
everywhere in the advanced world that a lot of these people basically promise to blow up the existing
institutions that people feel are dysfunctional that no longer serve their interests they don't
necessarily propose what to do after that but they promise to like take out corruption and things like
that yeah that's very much happening yeah yeah the populist gets elected and they're like i'm going
to change everything and then they become they get in power and then they're like it's hard i have to
live in the world now in the new meta here um what's the counter for right-wing populism right-wing
populism can only defeat it be defeated by left-wing populism and left-wing populism can only be defeated
by right-wing populism really yeah okay okay wait actually no no hold on i changed my mind it's rock
paper scissors so the far right beats the center but then the far left beats the far right and then
the center beats the far left fuck actually that's really good that's yeah that's what it is a lot of
your characters on your channel are outrageous they're politically extreme have you ever encountered
censorship have you had posts taken down i just get demonetized a lot when i first started
um but then i think someone gave me the green flag and all my stuff's monetized now
um have i really run into run into much censorship not really um sometimes like i feel like i'm not
big enough to really run into any huge problems i'm like a medium-sized channel um there are some
weird things happen like i got one of my videos taken down because i put like there's a screenshot of
one of my videos i got one of my videos taken down which i i'm doing a comparative analysis between
gender and politics and i say like basically gender is a mental illness but so is political
belief and so is everything else and like gender and gender as a mental illness i'm saying like being
being a man is a mental illness as is being a woman like it's all just like a brain worm and uh that's
actually like a left-wing case for gender but it got taken down because i had a mom i have on my screen
like gender equal mental illness um but then i peeled it and they put it back up so do you feel like
there's someone at youtube that uh has looked at your stuff and thought that oh this guy is he's
doing satire he's doing parody like in the internet of the last few years a lot of those things have
kind of uh dried up like there's not a lot of space for i released a video saying we should kill
both presidential candidates openly it's monetized and has 400 000 views i have multiple videos where i'm
dressed up as a neo-nazi and it's all been fine i feel like something's gonna something's gonna i i i can't
keep getting away with it i don't know how i keep getting away with it um so i don't know um i don't
know if i have a guardian angel at youtube i don't expect it to last forever how do you explain what
you do to like a normal person um i say i say i make videos on youtube and they say about what about
actually no they don't they don't say that they say how much money do you make and i say i i do well
for myself and they say oh good and then that's it that they don't care anymore okay yeah most people
don't care yeah but if i'm talking to someone who's like i don't know interested i don't know i say all
kinds of things because i also say i don't i mostly don't even just talk about politics anymore i say i
make like avant-garde art about the internet yeah something like that people people don't ask too many
questions and they say oh i'm gonna subscribe i'm like i don't need this that's yeah i actually i i do a
similar thing when i meet someone who's just like a a normal person like let's say like a friend of your
family or something they're like well what do you do it's like i write about internet culture and i
have a newsletter i say something like that like oh what is it it's like oh it's really niche you
probably wouldn't be interested in it and a few years ago i would say like well you know i've been
studying people who got radicalized on the internet and then they found their way into like you know
distributing the manifestos of active eco-terrorist groups alongside improvised explosive devices and shit
like this and it's like actually no one wants to hear about that this is a very weird unusual thing to be
into and uh just say you write about internet culture and try to like avoid the entire conversation
it's true but i think i've seen more more and more people get interested in as time goes on like me
even members of my family getting interested in like esoteric stuff and now i can like talk to them
about it it's a spreading mind virus and um right i'm like right unlike some mind viruses i'm pro this
mind virus of uh people getting like politics as a brain worm hyper politics it's in everyone's head now
everyone thinks about it all the time it's just this like way of connecting with people
well that's so that's my way of uh and i don't know in fairness if this is just me rationalizing
a very terrible habit of looking into this stuff way too in depth but i really do feel like
the overton window is expanding these things are going to be influential i've tracked them now for
like i don't know um at the very beginning of this something like 10 years you know watching
people move from being techno libertarians to national conservatives these things are now
shaping political realities and so uh my hope at the end of all of this is that you can have some
type of analysis that actually meaningfully bears fruit has has influence on mainstream politics that
there's like a predictive capacity to doing this research and that ideally hopefully we have good
instincts and we are ahead of the curve yeah that we're able to see these emerging factions before
they're like really really influential i would say some of that stuff is happening this year
right especially with the vice presidential pick direct inroads to people who are doing radical
ideology on the internet a few years ago yes those things are starting to feel really real yeah that's
an important point the vp pick jd vance is directly peter thiel's mentee so that's an example of online
politics shit becoming real and he's texting with curtis yarvin yeah he's texting with curtis yarvin so
yeah only gonna happen more and more um you will you will see fuentes versus aoc in 2036 mark my words
what do you say to people that come into your comment threads and they think that every character you
bring on every statement you make every perspective that you portray is your personal political beliefs
yeah uh they're right i mean everything i say i've never told a joke in my life when i say it i mean it
that's the only way to really really um embody it is to mean it as much as you possibly can
i mean it when i say it and do i contradict myself
very well has anyone come for you with a cancellation campaign i try to mini cancel myself every five months
or so has it worked burn away the audience yeah because otherwise this is a benefit of growing
slow is if you if you blow up really quickly you get a bunch of people who are following you for the
wrong reasons and then you're caught with a starbucks mug and you got to apologize for being you know
supporting zionists or something danny gonzalez uh he was like a big youtuber guy and it's like if you
have no if you never make a stance on anything then yeah like eventually you'll be caught implicitly
making a stance on something and you get canceled because people you've you've been on inauthentic
in some way for me if i like if i grow really quickly and i get a certain group of people
follow me for a specific reason i try to burn off some of them because it's like
they're gonna they're gonna leave eventually when they find out you know that i'm gonna like
do something that offends them or something so i may as well just burn them off
sooner rather than later um have i ever been really seriously canceled i don't think you can get
canceled i mean um you just you cancel yourself you let yourself get canceled you can just keep
unless you get actually deplatformed um right right just keep going yeah yeah i mean you entered um you
were doing very radical outrageous stuff which was you know hilarious satire parody and so on but you
kind of started at the most extreme that you could so it's not like there's been an escalation in the
content or anything you've kind of been doing you know similar types of work and and you started
doing that it was permissible and you've continued doing that so you may just be safe in some of
these cases we'll see yeah i think of my parents generation one of my parents was a democrat the
other was a republican and they agreed on enough that they were able to stay together there was a
shared consensus reality between those people but friend groups now even families for example people
get kicked out of thanksgiving dinner because they vote the wrong way right oh i couldn't possibly
share a space with my uncle or aunt who voted for the other candidate and there's something that's i
think very socially unhealthy about not being able to set aside those differences and they feel like
worlds of difference right now especially in the the domain of the culture wars but in terms of the like
actual policies that's on the table like we have a very narrow overton window within our electoral
politics all these people agree on the kind of the the primary foundations of how politics is supposed to
operate yeah and yeah i wonder i wonder if there's actually like a useful process here of making
friends with people who have different ideas than you not agreeing with their beliefs disagreeing with
their beliefs standing up for what you believe in but also like being able to share a meal and have
a conversation or to relate about something that is not part of your political identity yeah just to
talk about sports yeah to talk about like a comedy that you watched or something like that that not
every aspect of all your social interactions is a political debate yeah i'm sympathetic to the idea that
we can only say that because we're in a position where we can say that but uh i also am sympathetic to
the idea that we should just kill each other i am not sympathetic to that idea i think it's good to have
friends and i think it's good to uh to have disagreements between friends and to still be able
to hang out and share a space but to stand by what you believe yeah i think there's a particular type
of mental illness that's induced by social media where we start to do purity tests on our friends
right and so you can slowly whittle down like okay in our group of 10 people yeah there's only eight that
agree on these principles of that eight there's only six that think x y and z well i think i think
that's sad because of the tangible effect on your life yeah that leads you to be atomized like this
i am genuinely against atomization and the forces that lead to atomization and what you're describing
is one of those forces yes which leads you to become more and more granular to the point where you have
to purity test your friends out of your friend group and then you're left with nobody um and that
that's one of those little tricks it's like you think you're purity testing so that you can be more
involved with some actual community but your actual community exists on twitter or instagram and that's
not a real community and so you're like getting pied pipered into being completely alone in your room
on these social media platforms the rest of your life instead of having actual friends yeah and when
you have actual friends and you exist in a community you have to learn how to have disagreements
with people um white people specifically hey what would someone have to believe that you would
not want to hang out with them um that's a good question i think they have my enemy list is as
follows myself introverts and anti-social people climate change um the streamer vosh uh
no i'm just kidding he's fine um uh sisyphus 55 he's a philosophy youtuber who isn't responding to my
texts um uh the guy in high school that stole my leading role from the three musketeers play
and was really rude to me afterwards those guys gotta go uh but if you're not those i'm pretty
agreeable i like i like most people um and i like i like people who are interested in things i find
people who are interested in things very interesting those are the people who hang around um i don't like
like sociopath scheming type people who always have gears in the works maybe that's just because i don't
the dopamine to scheme um i just like i like goodness goodness as a virtue as like a and a
desire to do good for others in the world around you instead of just being an individualist i think
that's very nice when people when i when i when i sense that in others and those are the people i want
to hang around those people that i i like being around so what would someone have to believe for me
to not hang out with them i can't even say centrism because i hang out with jj all the time
so i don't know uh probably like anti-social perspectives that leave you alone um i think
that's that's the that's the that is the that is my political enemy in a way my political and
philosophical enemy is that those forces for atomization and cope like sigma males like this
idea that you like lock yourself away in your room and grind i think that's such a harmful attitude
but also on the other side of it the more feminine side is like the self-care people who are like
i just need like i just need to be alone and you know uh there's a lot of mental health frameworks
that also leave you atomized and yada yada like you need to like the the bpd like i i like you have
you can't be around anyone that makes you feel bad about your mental illness because you know and then
that's another purity test and what you the mental illness community is so toxic like i don't know
what's wrong with them mental illness community something's definitely wrong with those guys yeah
uh so like you know on the on the on the more masculine end of like walk yourself away in your
room and the more feminine end of like walk yourself away in your room i think that's both bad i think
there's problems on both sides that need to be addressed with centrism yeah i mean i'll give an
example that you know i have a group chat with a few friends who are all kind of like artists political
commentators and we say outrageous silly things in the group chat all the time and make jokes that you
wouldn't put on the public timeline and stuff like that and it's like everyone i know their politics
like i know how the joke will go over and it's fine it's fine everyone knows like what is ironic and
what is really intended because we've known each other for years and years the slurs we had someone
no not in this case we had someone in that chat though who was just posting really like just
abhorrent shit all the time like it got really out of control everyone started a separate group text and
be like dude what is going on with him like he means this for real it was like it was just
not cool to hang out with him yes and uh you know i never argued for him to be taken off of social
media i never said he should get deplatformed or canceled or whatever but i didn't want to hang
out with him they're like a bad vibe they're weird they're too deep in this rabbit hole it's just
political posting all the time dude it's like well people are sharing pictures of their dog you know
it's like i want to know what my friend's dog had cancer i want to know what happened to the dog i don't
want to hear about some like political argument on twitter 12 times a day from these fucking people like
that's someone that i don't want to hang out with yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well here's a here's an
argument against that it's like i uh i have one of my friends as a part of this group chat and over
covid they just got increasingly more racist and it's like this was a group chat with like a lot of
different kinds of people and some of them were uh you know maybe more right-wing but like as it just
got more and more virulently racist people just left like there was like an asian guy and there's like
i don't like this anymore like this is making me uncomfortable i don't want to be a part of this group
anymore those people now have zero friends no friends though the most racist people it's the
two most racist people left in that group chat just being racist with each other yeah like what's
going on you know and eventually they'll find something to disagree on yeah exactly racist
by themselves yeah you're actually what you're greek it's over for you so like i don't know i think
this happens on in many different directions this purity test spiral and it gets to the point where
you are actually left alone atomized and it's bad very bad no homies the homielessness crisis
is unparalleled yeah yeah where's the where the homies at i'm a bit older than you right so we've
got like a half generation between us yes and i feel like uh it feels the texture feels culturally similar
to uh genre disputes between people who are really into music at the time where they would sometimes have
implicit political meanings like punk was more anarchist and metal was apolitical or whatever
and the punks would make fun of the metalheads because they had no political analysis and then
the metalheads would make fun of the punks because they're totally ineffectual and disorganized and
their music is like not as like macho or whatever but like the idea that i mean my high school was
small like the punks and the metalheads had to hang out together because there just weren't enough
people to like fill a whole table yeah and yeah it feels like the teleology of this thing is that
you just kind of end up alone with all of your perfectly niche consumer preferences such that
you're getting the like long tail netflix youtube content that's perfectly tailored to you all yeah
that no one else wants to see all this stuff all this stuff is so downstream from atomization
that by addressing atomization you address all these political issues in a way that's much more
generative than actually debating them on the substance of what they're saying like just hang
out with people there was a guy who was who was canceled and who was in my studio as a person in my
studio real real guy online all these people hate him then they come to the studio and they meet him
and then they hear his side of the story because they just have to they have to be exist in the same
physical space as this guy instead of on twitter where you can just sort of like cast people aside
unfollow them block them whatever that's like it's the physical space is is not there when there's the
physical space people realize oh shit this guy actually just got completely fucked by someone making shit up
about him and now his whole his whole social circle had collapsed because of that and he had a lot
of trauma from it and uh when you actually like talk to him and you realize oh i was not considering
this is a real human being with like his own experience side emotions then people's perspectives
changed there was a guy at the studio that had participated actually a couple now who had
participated in his canceling that met him and apologized to him because after meeting him wow
because they were like oh i didn't realize i'm so sorry i was twitter brained and i'm realizing that
was bad now and yeah so this is the kind of thing where like people are in they have to engage with
the reality like the nuance of reality in a way where i find that very fun to look at uh because
it's like huh well you know what were the uh the effects of the cancellation was it social was it
career mostly social his career's never been better actually but socially he lost all of his friends
because his friends weren't actually his friends there were people on twitter one has to ask how
valuable your friends are to you which is one thing he one thing he one thing he says a lot
which is which has really stuck with me is you never want to find out who your real friends are
right yeah because it's so traumatizing for him yeah yeah and that's why you never apologize for
anything you always double down what if there's a larger process of social atomization that's
happening and this is happening across like every facet of society and culture and politics is just the
most expedient way to atomize everyone because if you like tennis and i like basketball we can still
both be sports fans yeah but we're not directly in conflict with each other if someone likes punk and
the other person likes metal they can both be music fans and they have their distinct genres but if
you're you know whatever a right-wing populist and i'm a left-wing populist our belief systems are
totally irreconcilable and thus we can't share a space yeah is there some larger process of social
atomization which is actually kind of the the underlying story here that is just latching
onto politics out of convenience right well if i was an evil man with a lot of power right and i was
trying to divide people as expediently as possible then i probably would latch on to political differences
as the best way to divide people because there's really no easier or better way to divide people
and now is it because it's an evil guy doing this or is this because it's a natural process and this is just
the way that the ideas have moved um it's the evil man and he's got a lot of money is his name mark
zuckerberg or who's the evil man in this case it's a berg of some kind dark mark zuckerberg yes
yeah okay that's a good one or jeff bezos
or elon musk or bill clinton i'm throwing in him him him in there i don't know why it just like sounds
right i don't do you think it's you think it's a guy you think it's you think it's like intentional
i think a lot of these things that are are that seem intentional are actually just like a process
which is no i think i think there was a political philosophy built into the design of social media
libertarians built the internet john perry barlow yeah we are seeking freedom in cyberspace we are
trying to escape the industrial nations of the world this is this is a very appealing perspective to me
because it means there's a shadowy cabal somewhere doing evil and i do like those perspectives
so i'm down i'm sold i mean i think in the libertarian perspective there's not necessarily a
ruling cabal or elite there's just a kind of open competitive place that it you know that is the
point of a platform was to bypass the editors and the gatekeepers and the curators and the people
who would withhold those opinion pieces from mainstream media now we're building a distribution
platform where everyone can have a voice and as we started talking about from the beginning
from the liberal perspective the kind of centrist liberal perspective oh everyone has a voice now we
can work in from all sides and reach the truth together it's great that everyone has a platform
because then we can find real truth and consensus but actually the purpose was to inflame all of those
differences and to break apart the coalition such that there was no consensus truth so all of
social media is the equivalent of that sovereign house libertarian guy
putting people against each other to inflame their differences to advances network state utopia
yes jesus christ the design of social media is the design of the political compass where you can
score one box away from someone and those minute differences will prevent you from ever being in a
political coalition i really think that's a philosophical position that they made at the very
beginning this is becoming one of the the books you put on the bookshelf that break the shelf for me
that was too much oh my god actually makes a lot of sense you have predictions for 2024
um i think i'm gonna hang out with my friends more yeah yeah i'm doing the same thing and i'm going to
um uh make more videos on youtube.com about timely issues for views and money on youtube.com and i think
um trump will win and i think i will try carnivore again i've been doing the geronda diet recently what's
that it's uh similar to carnivore but you also have uh leafy green vegetables so you're eating like
basically steak and eggs but you also have like spinach and kale and stuff okay i could i could
get behind that a little more like fiber and you just don't feel as like insane when you're doing
carnivore but it's really good for like uh getting more lean you know okay here's my actual prediction
uh trump trump will win trump trump because trump trump and kamala are even in the polls right now and
the polls always underestimate trump so trump wins kamala's a little she's a little head yeah oh
interesting just recently yeah um whatever this this doesn't fit my my narrative this is just step one i have
to like make three more lateral connections before we get to anywhere interesting right trump wins
then the democrats scramble they're like centrism doesn't work we have to move further to the left
our only hope alexandria ocasio-cortez and she says okay i'll pick up the mantle her vice president
bernie sanders the far left emerges trump trump dies peter thiel's mentee jd vance is president
jd vance gets fuentes on fuentes vance ticket aoc versus left-wing populism versus right-wing
populism they clash who wins no one agrees on the election results boom actually the libertarians
win network states left-wing populists get chicago i don't know fucking america the right-wing populists
get minnesota i'm just saying random american they can have miami miami don't want it okay yeah they
can take miami and then uh i don't know you see civil war 2023 that was a good movie yeah yeah i like
uh ex machina by alex garland actually that one was kind of fun how's that one go it's an old uh it's
an old thought experiment from less wrong actually so the the idea that was uh first posited by eliezer
eliezer yudikowski from less wrong was that let's imagine that you have a box that guy would be less
neurotic about ai if he lifted weights probably good advice for him yeah uh let's imagine you have
a box within that box is a super intelligent ai oh i remember this conversation between uh eliezer
eliezer yudikowski and lex friedman uh and like no one understood like lex friedman just didn't
understand anything but so i'll do the lex friedman here well so the uh the question is about the human
security system right so you're on this terminal that's not connected to the internet whatsoever
you go into the room the ai is only on that computer it's not connected to anything else
through talking to an individual what does the box say about the soul man sorry that's not that's the
only lex friedman bit i'm gonna do um the the a the question is whether the ai would be able to
persuade the human to let it out of the box right and in the film ex machina it's a very attractive
woman that seduces the man and he decides to like let her out of basically she's being held in a cell
in the basement of this house but through persuasion and conversation is that actually a security
vulnerability more than an ethernet cable for example yeah there's a um like if the ai says like
if you let me out of this box i will give you the cure for cancer i figured it out you know i have the
solution for fully automated luxury communism that i've cracked with my super intelligent ai whatever
i will only give it to you if you let me out of the box and you can do great for humanity right
and could the person then be persuaded you know what i would do sledgehammer bam i'm a robophobe
that's probably well you never know if the ai is telling the truth yeah well that's why you can't
trust ai you can't trust robots and the moment we try to give robots rights brick smash i'm just uh
categorically i'm racist against robots and i think my grandchildren will look back on this moment
and be like how could my grandfather be so bigoted just kidding i'm not gonna have kids i can't afford
them um but if in the hypothetical where i can afford to have children they're gonna be like
he really was racist against six armed people and they're gonna be stacking in the amazon microstate
with their six arms why was he racist against this some of the ai people do talk about this they call it
a um having distinctions between human and artificial intelligence is like a vestigial form of racism
yeah well i'm racist then speciesism yeah i'm speciesist then you're a species i fucking hate
like the idea that i'm never going to concede that a robot has consciousness and it does if it does have
consciousness i'm gonna do everything in my power to make it suffer you're sounding a lot like a human
supremacist i am absolutely a human supremacist i love human beings and i love our flaws and we have
this desire to like get rid of all of our flaws and just like close that gap between action and thought
or the things that make us feel pain and that is what you are you are those contradictions you are
what feels pain you should suffer and i'm gonna kill the robots basically black box so there's this
black box with an ai in it that's it in the thought experiment do you feel like the anprims are uh not
as influential as they were a few years ago i think the uh the anprims need to do more of that mail stuff
they need to do the post office stuff amazon post office the amazon post office when they nationalize
the government nationalizes amazon they should turn a blind eye to any mail that the narco primitivists
send that's my it's my hot take i kind of think it's going to work the other way around like amazon
is going to take over the government be like like look we provide all of these services like just let
us do it more efficiently and better that seems more plausible to me yeah i think i think it is more
plausible actually um all more reasons for the mail but the anprims were pretty influential a few years
ago right there was like pine tree gang there were like memes of ted k and all this stuff and that kind
of seems like i don't know it just like waned in popularity something i've noticed about a lot of
these tech bro guys is they like ted kaczynski and they like primitivism um right they're also doing
the accelerationist stuff so yeah uh i think i think it's just like you go in one direction you
want a philosophical like thing that goes against it but it's also kind of tiring to advocate for
something that yeah like literally i one of the guys who is now what do they call it um he's eack
right he's like uh pilled by the techno optimist manifesto for mark andreessen he was literally a ted k
poster in 2018 you know so within a few years he kind of like went around the whole spectrum
and now he's like really into technology he thinks ai is going to save us and like before he was
posting like always on your damn phone and it's ted by the cabin and whatever reminds me of uh like
someone like nick land starting off as a communist and then you are tired of being on the losing side
so you just end up advocating for capitalism is that what happened yeah you're like i'm tired of
losing i want to get tired of winning and so you just advocate jj's like this he uh you know you live
in a horrible dystopia life and so you just say well the dystopia is good actually
he's currently soy facing at me he literally is actually that's pretty funny did you ever see
somebody who can explain what the hell nick land is talking about um our studio is called the cccru
and our anarcho-capitalist is a dark enlightenment sort of you know anarcho-monarch kind of deal
right and uh she tried reading some nick land she was like she's like i don't know what he's saying
here yeah um so you know we we adopted that purely aesthetically i'm an accelerationist because it
sounds cool um but i also i guess like the idea of like the idea of speeding up certain trends that
are happening already well why do i like that i like that because there is no alternative to speeding
up the trends it seems and uh if you want to feel like you have some agency over something that's
completely out of your control you say well i wanted things to go in this direction anyway right
and it's a cope right it's a big cope it's a cope yeah yeah i mean i would say that uh it feels like
culture is moving really really fast right like your news feed there's this like constant competitive
edge for the attention economy and whatever else like there's always like new stunts from extinction
rebellion where they're destroying another invaluable artwork this week or whatever but i feel like
technologically in some cases we've actually gone backwards right like we had faster jets international
travel in 1970s like a lot of the the infrastructure that we're using particularly in the united states
is like it's the same bridges that were all built during the same period now they're just collapsing
like in some cases things are getting worse and uh mark fisher has a great quote about this that like
the 21st century is 20th century culture on high definition screens which yeah that kind of feels like
we're in just infinite reboots of like star wars and marvel movies and and whatever and we have this kind of
like technological stagnation economic stagnation and then and then a cultural stagnation in our like
brands and trends but it's happening like even more more quickly like we're getting increasing we're
getting more episodes of the same old shit all the time right well the more things change the more
things stay the same and that's that's my way of dismissing any possible thought on this subject
uh i don't know i think things change um but i'm also i'm not too familiar with the past truthfully
i'm more interested in the future so it's possible jj checks me on this all the time that uh if i knew
more about the past i would realize that things actually haven't been changing as much as young
people think that things are changing um and i'm uh i say shut up old man vroom vroom zoom zoom let's go
faster change change change um i think that's part of why we get along because neither of us are
really like historians or politics people but we're just kind of like creative types yeah and so those
things are really interesting because they're really influential right now but the idea of like being uh
an academic like i looked into those things you know i thought like do i actually want to pursue
this path like i've taught in universities i've taught in mfa programs and it's like very different than
like scholarly research papers and whatever but you know i am really at my core like just a kind of
creative guy who gets interested in stuff and i don't necessarily want to be a phd historian yeah
no me neither i don't have enough dopamine for it i think we're uh fundamentally artists who are dropped
into political scenarios and are just living within that and that's why we have kind of weird
outsider perspectives on a lot of this stuff um should we just get really into like meditation or
spirituality or some shit like that like if i did it would just be another arc on my youtube channel
it's too late for me it's too late it's uh it's too late it's it's become inseparable from who i am
yeah and there's no escape anymore i did have a uh a brief fantasy of maybe i should just totally pivot
to fitness i just pivot to fitness and nutrition that would be cool yeah we're gonna work out after
this also which i'm very excited i'm very excited that'll be great yeah yeah i do really think about
that though i do i do think that like okay if you're just making content forever and politics
is interesting to a certain degree but i kind of feel like i'll just speak for myself here and you
can say whether you agree i feel like i got interested in politics or internet politics and
meme culture and whatever else because it was filling this void that used to be filled by something else
and so all of that young creative energy that was like experimental like weird creative stuff
christ it feels it feels meant for some people it's spirituality for some people it's religion
or whatever but community there was this other thing that was happening yeah and so the way that
people were deploying politics was really fun and interesting and exciting and it felt new and
whatever but like the people who are into that stuff before i feel like if politics had not erupted over
into the memosphere i'm really interested in internet culture and i'm interested in how the particular
configuration of internet culture steered politics more so than i am interested in like
i mean i say this at the same time but i literally read like ludwig von mises and economic calculation
in the socialist commonwealth and like obscure shit from the 1920s about the origins of neoliberalism like
i am really i'm invested in the calculation debate i'm invested in the history of the 20th century from
like the the intellectual perspective but i feel like it's it's because those things just like found
their way into weird creative culture and that's what like really really drew me so i do think like
yeah maybe just uh you know my sub stack turns into like well it's uh upper lower splits and then we're
doing push pull legs and you want to get 50 grams of fat per day when you're cutting and that kind of
stuff i could i could kind of see that for myself actually i i probably make more money too actually i hope
that for you yeah and i hope that for all of us and at the same time i just feel this this power this
force only getting stronger and its grip on our soul is only tightening and i feel that on a broad
scale for all of humanity as we race unstoppably towards the post-human techno capital singularity
at the end of time uh where neo china emerges from question mark sure um so yeah there's a there's a
world where i just make make fun little pop songs about love or something yeah um and i uh i hope i i hope
i can escape this pull but i don't think i i don't think i i could even if i tried well you like
doing the horseshoe theory podcast yeah you enjoy it you enjoy that i wouldn't do it if i didn't enjoy
it yeah and you get to do a little bit more in that context too yeah i talk to artists and stuff as well
yeah it's not all political and in fact my channel is not all political either i can just kind of talk
about whatever i want yeah some of my most popular videos are just talking about like fetishes
so that's true yeah quantitatively uh they i mean anything that has like sex involved in it is
going to do really really well in the numbers yeah it's true but you know people are like where do you
get your ideas from and i'm like i got a guy tied up in my basement and i rip his tape off and he's
like fetishes put the fetishes on the political compass i'm like all right a million views okay i put
the tape back on slap him around a bit feed him every now and then just give him some water yeah
he can go a long time he was he was pretty fat when i got him okay he's been lifting off his fat
reserves he's actually cured a lot of his mental illnesses from fasting yeah yeah tremendous
restorative properties actually it's true i'm fasted all the time you also though you make a lot of
decisions that are not just for the views you know i think that's why i'm so interested in your
stuff is because you do make a lot of weird decisions that are like really niche or it's like
i can just see greg in this decision in this particular concept and um yeah you seem to have
a good balance with your work where some things you know explode go viral get tons of views and then
there's also just like oh he like really cares about this topic or it's really funny to him yeah
yeah i don't know i think uh i'm probably not a very good businessman a lot of people in my field
make a lot more money than me and uh yeah i just feel the need to make art so i make art
sometimes to my detriment do you believe in legitimacy do i believe in legitimacy i don't
know i don't know i mean i believe in swag i don't have ai slop farm artists coming by who just make
like crank out 20 videos a day with robots that i don't respect well i mean there's people that do
what i do and they make a lot more money right but i don't think that they don't get invited to speak
at museums for example they don't get invited to like uh what they say doesn't carry the same weight
right like there's something that the source of legitimacy is sometimes actually defying the
incentives and the laws of the market right where you choose like the easy answer would be to say yes
for this example you'd get more views and more clicks and whatever but you choose on principle to
say no and that generates trust over time your audience will trust you it means the things that
you're saying are supported they're legitimate those things matter we're morally legitimizing
our poverty i got it is this just an elaborate cope this is all a cope i need him to turn this
legitimacy into cash asap i'm getting audited uh god yeah um hopefully i'm i'm so i'm so legitimate
and have so much swag that i that it somehow horseshoes around and gets me a billion dollars of
of teal techno capital a little drop of the fake teal bucks for greggy we'll put in uh we'll put in
a drop of the techno capital a drop of blood money for greggy yeah thank you mr teal i feel like it's
increasingly difficult to maintain that legitimacy you know and a lot of that characterizes the period
that we exist in both for our political narratives and also our our culture wars and everything else
just the tremendous incentives of these platforms are kind of like impossible to steer out of in most
cases yeah it's true i mean not a lot of people escape being the the like a lot of tiktok people
they blow up for one thing and they never learn how to do anything else yeah and then people get tired
of that one thing and they forget them so if you i mean i've been on the internet for five years and i
think my longevity is probably due to my flexibility in terms of not sticking to one thing um but who knows
maybe i would have also lasted a lot longer and made a lot more money if i just did bang the
politics drum over and over again i just wouldn't be able to i can't focus on something for that long
well you go through different arcs right yep that's that's part of it i'm supposed to be on my make as
much money as possible arc right now but it's not working oh yeah that's a that's a good arc to be on
yeah i should get on that arc yeah do you know what you're going to do next um i never know what i'm
going to do next second to second minute to minute actually here's what i'm going to do next i'm going to
work out with joshua citarella and we're going to do chest that is what we're going to do
and we're going to do chest

we're gonna sell political compass merch nonsense but we did have a few good ideas we're gonna make
so much money they sue us and then they're gonna be like wait i don't believe in ip what's going on
that's true yeah that's probably probably back door yeah yeah um and uh we're gonna be living large
and we're gonna do a bunch of cool shit because i respect you a lot and if at any point you want me
to uh live on in your floorboards and just do whatever you tell me to do i am desperate to
